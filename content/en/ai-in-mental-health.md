## AI in mental health research

Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising numerous fields, and mental health research is no exception. By harnessing the power of AI, researchers are gaining unprecedented insights into the complexities of mental health, leading to more effective interventions and treatments.

One notable example of AI's impact is the development of tools like **Harmony**. This [innovative AI tool](/psychology-ai-tool/), originally funded by the Wellcome Trust as part of the [Wellcome data prize](/ai-in-mental-health/radio-podcast-about-wellcome-data-prize/) and later by UKRI, uses natural language processing (NLP) to streamline the [harmonisation of mental health questionnaires](/data-harmonisation/find-matching-and-common-items-in-questionnaires-and-surveys/). By automating this time-consuming process, Harmony enables researchers to compare data across studies more efficiently, leading to more robust and reliable [secondary data analysis](/ai-in-mental-health/ppie-for-secondary-data-analysis/).


We have recently published a paper in BMC Psychiatry validating Harmony for real-world data:  McElroy, E., Wood, T.A., Bond, R., Mulvenna M., Shevlin M., Ploubidis G., Scopel Hoffmann M., Moltrecht B., [Using natural language processing to facilitate the harmonisation of mental health questionnaires: a validation study using real-world data](/ai-in-mental-health/bmc-psychiatry-paper/). BMC Psychiatry 24, 530 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-024-05954-2


## Other uses of AI for mental health research

Beyond Harmony, AI is being used in a wide range of mental health research applications:

* **Predictive Modelling:** AI algorithms can analyse large datasets to identify patterns and predict future outcomes, such as the likelihood of a relapse or the effectiveness of a particular treatment.
* **Natural Language Processing:** NLP tools can analyse text data, such as social media posts or clinical notes, to gain insights into mental health conditions and identify potential risk factors.
* **Machine Learning:** Machine learning algorithms can be trained on vast amounts of data to develop models that can diagnose mental health conditions with greater accuracy than traditional methods.
* **Virtual Reality:** AI-powered virtual reality experiences can be used to simulate real-world situations and provide exposure therapy for conditions like anxiety and phobias.

As AI technology [continues to advance](/ai-in-mental-health/harmony-going-forward/), we can expect to see even more groundbreaking applications in mental health research. By leveraging the power of AI, researchers are paving the way for a brighter future for individuals struggling with mental health challenges. As uses of AI in mental health become more commonplace, we are expecting research funders to develop [frameworks for AI governance](/ai-in-mental-health/research-funders-ai-governance/).
