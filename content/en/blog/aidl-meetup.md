## Tech Talk at the AI|DL AI Meetup (London) Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning for Enterprise

Thomas Wood will present the Harmony project at the AI|DL AI meet up on **8 October 2024**.

Topic: **Harmony: a free online tool using LLMs for research in psychology and social sciences**

Speaker: [Thomas Wood](https://freelancedatascientist.net/) ([Fast Data Science](https://fastdatascience.com/))

Description: Thomas Wood will present our work on Harmony, harmonydata.ac.uk, which is a free online tool that uses generative AI and LLMs to help researchers compare items in questionnaires such as GAD-7 (used to measure anxiety), even when they are written in different languages. Harmony is open source under MIT License and is written in Python, and uses HuggingFace Sentence Transformers to find similarities between questionnaires. Harmony will soon allow researchers to discover datasets using a vector search.

Location: TBD

Date: 8 October 2024
