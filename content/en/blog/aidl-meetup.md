## Tech Talk at the AI|DL AI Meetup (London) Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning for Enterprise

Thomas Wood presents the Harmony project at the 19th [AI and Deep Learning for Enterprise meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ai-and-dl-for-enterprise/events/303641323) on **8 October 2024**.

**In case you missed the talk about Harmony on Tuesday at Civo Tech Junction with AI and Deep Learning for Enterprise sponsored by Daemon, you can now watch the recording of the live stream on AI|DL's channel.**

Topic: **Harmony: a free online tool using LLMs for research in psychology and social sciences**

Speaker: [Thomas Wood](https://freelancedatascientist.net/) ([Fast Data Science](https://fastdatascience.com/))

Description: Thomas Wood will present our work on Harmony, harmonydata.ac.uk, which is a [free online tool](/psychology-ai-tool/) that uses generative AI and LLMs to help researchers compare items in questionnaires such as [GAD-7](/compare-harmonise-instruments/gad-7-vs-sdq/) (used to measure anxiety), even when they are [written in different languages](/nlp-semantic-text-matching/harmony-on-kufungisisa-a-cultural-concept-of-distress-from-zimbabwe/). Harmony is open source under [MIT License](https://github.com/harmonydata/harmony/blob/main/LICENSE) and is written in Python, and uses [HuggingFace Sentence Transformers](/nlp-semantic-text-matching/measuring-the-performance-of-nlp-algorithms/) to find similarities between questionnaires.

[Harmony Discovery](/discovery/) will soon allow researchers to discover datasets using a [vector search](/nlp-semantic-text-matching/how-does-harmony-work/).

## Where and where to find the AI|DL AI Meetup
