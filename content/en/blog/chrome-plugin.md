[Beta mode: we are currently testing this extension]

We have developed a browser extension for Harmony called "Send to Harmony" which lets you send selected text to Harmony with a right-click. For PDFs, use the popup to paste your selected text.

Send to Harmony enables users to send selected text to the Harmony Data Harmonization (https://harmonydata.ac.uk/) platform for analysis. This plugin provides a right-click or context menu item which allows users to easily bring text from  into their harmonisations, making it easier to compare and analyze different measurement scales across research studies.

Simply select the text you want to send to Harmony, right click and select "Send to Harmony" - Your items will open in a new tab.
