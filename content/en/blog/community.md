## Join the Harmony community on Discord!

Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/harmonydata)

We now have a Harmony channel on Discord.
Discord is an app that lets you text, chat, and communicate with others using video and audio (kind of like Skype). You can create a group chat for people who want to talk about the same general topic, or communicate with someone one-on-one. 

This is going to be a part of our community building project, as we are aiming to build up our thriving open source community.

You can also follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harmony_data), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/harmonydata/about/?viewAsMember=true), and other social media channels.

The more people join, the higher our Discord will rank and the easier it is to bring more people on board the project!
