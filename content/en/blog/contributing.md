# Join the chorus and contribute to the Harmony project

Are you a data wrangler with a passion for precision? A language maestro eager to unlock the secrets of meaning? Or simply someone who loves seeing research soar when data sings in harmony? Then raise your metaphorical pitchfork (or keyboard) and get ready to join the chorus, because Harmony needs YOU!

Harmony, the NLP-powered project harmonising diverse data across studies, is more than just code and algorithms. We're a vibrant community of researchers, developers, and data enthusiasts united by a common goal: **to make the world's research data sing in perfect harmony.**

We're not talking about some dusty archive locked away in a digital vault. We're talking about unleashing the full potential of the research buried within, enabling deeper analyses, groundbreaking discoveries, and ultimately, a better understanding of the world around us.

And here's where you come in. Whether you're a seasoned coder with a PhD in NLP, a data whiz with an eye for patterns, or a beginner brimming with fresh ideas, your voice matters. We welcome diverse perspectives, skillsets, and backgrounds because true harmony comes from the music of many instruments.

**Here's what awaits you in the Harmony orchestra:**

* **The thrill of collaboration:** Imagine working alongside a passionate team, bouncing ideas off each other, and witnessing the birth of groundbreaking solutions.
* **The impact of your work:** Every line of code, every insightful analysis, every bug tackled contributes directly to making research more accessible and impactful.
* **The joy of learning:** Join workshops, attend conferences, and dive into the ever-evolving world of NLP. We believe in fostering an environment of continuous learning and growth.
* **The satisfaction of building something meaningful:** Be part of a project with real-world implications, empowering researchers around the globe to unlock the true potential of their data.

So, are you ready to join the chorus? We're always looking for talented individuals to join our team.

* **Contribute to our open-source code:** Whether you're a seasoned developer or a curious newbie, your contributions are valued.
* **Join the conversation:** Share your ideas, suggestions, and feedback on our forum and social media channels.

Every voice, every skillset, every perspective adds another layer of richness to the Harmony symphony. So, pick up your instrument, tune your voice, and get ready to play! Together, we can make the world's research data sing a chorus of discovery and progress.

# Coding 

Harmony is mostly coded in Python. We use Pycharm IDE.

Please make sure all code you commit is linted using the Pycharm default linter. If you use a different one, this will make the code history hard to follow.

# Getting started

Please familiarise yourself with Git. You can [fork Harmony](https://github.com/harmonydata/harmony/fork) and [make a pull request](https://github.com/harmonydata/harmony/pulls) any time! We're glad to have your contribution.

**Come on, let's harmonise the world!**
