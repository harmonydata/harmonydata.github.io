# How should I format my file for Harmony?

Harmony supports the following file types:

* Word - [download an example Word doc formatted for Harmony](/gad7example.docx)
* Excel - [download an example Excel spreadsheet formatted for Harmony with two tabs for two questionnaires](/gad7scaredexample.xlsx)
* CSV - [download an example tab separated CSV file formatted for Harmony](/gad7example.csv)
* PDF - [download an example tabular PDF document formatted for Harmony](/gad7example.pdf)

If you want to upload multiple questionnaires in a single file, you can use Excel format and put them in separate tabs.

In all cases we recommend clearly supplying question numbers, question texts, and removing extraneous information such as copyright disclaimers for best results.

If you are having trouble parsing a document in Harmony, you can [raise an issue](https://github.com/harmonydata/harmony/issues) or [try our troubleshooting tips](/troubleshooting-harmony).
