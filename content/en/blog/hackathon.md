**What will we be working on?**

This Hackathon is to improve Harmony in general and we would like help with a number of areas - your team could pick one or choose your own! If you donâ€™t have a team, donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ll get you involved on the day! 

:computer: Weâ€™ll be working on a range of problems, you can find a full list on our Github 

* Task 1: [PDF parsing](https://github.com/harmonydata/hackathon/blob/main/1-pdf-parsing.md)
* Task 2: [Improve matching of items by semantic similarity](https://github.com/harmonydata/hackathon/blob/main/2-matching.md)
* Task 3: [Experimenting with LLMs](https://github.com/harmonydata/hackathon/blob/main/3-add-llms.md)
* Task 4: [Adapting Harmony to other domains such as medical history or Informed Consent Forms](https://github.com/harmonydata/hackathon/blob/main/4-other-domains.md)
* Task 5: [Making Harmony multilingual](https://github.com/harmonydata/hackathon/blob/main/5-multilingual.md)
* Task 6: [Getting Likert scales out of documents](https://github.com/harmonydata/hackathon/blob/main/6-likert.md)
* Task 7: [Making a similarity score between instruments using the Word Movers Distance algorithm](https://github.com/harmonydata/hackathon/blob/main/7-similarity.md)
