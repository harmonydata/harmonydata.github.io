# **How to Harmonise Questionnaires - 10 Practical Steps (+ 1 Bonus Tip)**

Data privacy is a big challenge today. It's all about what we share and what we don't. Zoher Karu said it well: “One of the biggest challenges is around data privacy and what is shared versus what is not shared. And my perspective on that is consumers are willing to share if there’s value returned. One-way sharing is not going to fly anymore. So how do we protect and how do we harness that information and become a partner with our consumers rather than just a vendor for them?”

This quote really highlights the importance of effective questionnaires. They're not just about gathering data – they're about building trust and delivering value to those who share their information with us. But there's a catch – the data we collect from these questionnaires needs to be well organised and analysed.

This is where the challenge of non-harmonised data comes in, and it truly can be a problem when you have differently formatted surveys with different questions and scales. The questionnaires might not even be in the same language. Analysing the data straight-up is like trying to complete a jigsaw puzzle where the pieces are from different sets (it’s quite literally impossible). So, we need to get our questionnaires to work in harmony with each other.

In this guide, you'll discover 10 practical steps – and we've thrown in an extra one for good measure – to assist you in the harmonisation of questionnaire data. These data harmonisation steps are designed to make the process smoother, so that your collected data is not just abundant but also rich in insights and meaning.

## **1\. Define Clear Objectives**

The first and foremost step in harmonising questionnaires is to define clear objectives. What do you want to achieve with your questionnaire?

Understanding the purpose behind your data collection is key. No matter if it's gathering customer feedback, conducting market research, or measuring employee satisfaction, your objectives will guide every aspect of your questionnaire design.

Clear goals guarantee that each question serves a specific purpose and contributes to the overall aim of your survey. This focus prevents the inclusion of irrelevant questions and helps maintain the respondents' engagement – resulting in higher response rates and more accurate data.

(Of course, this step is only possible before collecting the actual data. If you are already dealing with data from different questionnaires that don’t match, you might want to skip to step 6.)

## **2\. Standardize Question Formats**

Consistency is key when it comes to questionnaire design. Standardizing question formats across your surveys not only maintains a professional appearance but also enhances the quality of the data collected.

By using a consistent format, you make it easier for respondents to understand and answer the questions, reducing the likelihood of confusion or misinterpretation. This uniformity also facilitates easier data analysis and comparison, especially when dealing with multiple questionnaires over time or across different segments. S

Standardization can include aspects like using the same scale for rating questions (e.g., 1-5), maintaining a consistent order (e.g., always starting with demographic questions), and using a uniform language style. This way your data is reliable, comparable, and easier to interpret, which leads to more accurate insights and informed decision-making.

## **3\. Ensure Scalability**

Designing questionnaires that are scalable across various contexts or projects is essential. Scalability helps make sure that your questionnaire remains relevant and effective, regardless of the scope or size of your project. To achieve this, do the following:

- **Flexibility:** Design questions that are adaptable to different situations. Avoid overly specific questions that might not apply in varied contexts.
- **Modularity:** Structure your questionnaire in sections that can be easily added or removed depending on the project's needs.
- **Broad Applicability:** Create and ask questions that are applicable to a wide range of respondents for the collection of meaningful data across different groups.

A scalable questionnaire is not just about reaching a larger audience – it’s about maintaining consistency and relevance in diverse scenarios.

## **4\. Incorporate Logical Flow**

A logical sequence of questions is fundamental for keeping respondents engaged and for collecting high-quality data. What do you need to do to achieve a logical flow?

- Start with general questions and gradually move to more specific ones. This eases respondents into the survey and makes them more comfortable to provide detailed responses later.
- Group related questions together. This helps respondents focus on one topic at a time and provides clearer insights during analysis.
- Use transitional phrases or brief explanations when shifting from one topic to another. This helps respondents understand the change in context and maintains their engagement.

## **5\. Test and Revise**

Testing your questionnaire before fully deploying it is a critical step. This process allows you to identify and rectify any issues so that your questionnaire effectively meets its objectives. Here's how to approach this step:

- **Pilot Testing:** Conduct a pilot test with a small, diverse group of respondents. This helps in identifying unclear questions, technical issues, or any other obstacles that might affect the data collection.
- **Gather Feedback:** Actively seek feedback from your test participants. Ask them about their understanding of the questions, the flow of the questionnaire, and any difficulties they encountered.
- **Analyse Responses:** Look at the test responses critically. Are there patterns of confusion or non-responses in certain sections? This can indicate areas that need refinement.
- **Revise Accordingly:** Use the insights gained from the pilot test to make necessary adjustments. This might involve rephrasing questions, tweaking the order of questions, or altering the format for clarity and ease of response.

The goal of testing and revising is not just to fix errors, but to refine your questionnaire to make sure it is as effective and user-friendly as possible.

## **6\. Standardize Question Formats with Harmony's NLP**

Now, if it is already too late to tweak the questionnaires and you are feeling stranded with a bunch of data that can’t be analysed together, don’t freak out! We have a solution that fixes this problem in a heartbeat: Our tool [Harmony](https://harmonydata.ac.uk/).

Harmony uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to assist researchers in the retrospective harmonisation of questionnaire items. It’s a very sophisticated tool that was developed through a collaboration between esteemed institutions such as Ulster University, University College London, and others. It can identify both similarities and differences across a variety of questionnaire items.

Curious about how the data harmonisation process works? Notably, Harmony doesn't rely on conventional dictionary approaches or word lists. Instead, it utilizes Transformer neural network architectures, which enhance its ability to process and understand the nuances of language in questionnaire contexts.

If this sounds too technical, here’s how it works in real life: For instance, researchers can upload mental health questionnaires in diverse formats like PDF or Excel. Harmony then analyses these questionnaires to determine which questions are identical, similar in meaning, or even antonyms of each other. This facilitates a more nuanced and accurate harmonisation process.

## **7\. Achieve Multilingual Harmonisation**

You might have data from different countries all over the world (which is amazing), but now you don’t know how to analyse this data and make sense of it together. After all, what good is all this diverse data if you can’t get the results and answers you need from it?

Harmony can help you out again! One of the unique and groundbreaking capabilities of the data harmonisation tool is its proficiency in multilingual data harmonisation. This feature is particularly vital for global research studies that involve data collection across different linguistic groups. Its smart use of natural language processing means it can work with languages far and wide, which guarantees that every piece of data fits perfectly, no matter where it's from.

Particularly in mental health research, where the subtleties of language matter, the ability to map datasets from various languages can open doors to new insights into issues like social isolation and anxiety.

So, if you are struggling with the fact that your data is in more than one language, Harmony might be the fastest solution to translate and harmonise your questionnaire data.

## **8\. Integrate Multifaceted Data Sources**

So, you have your data but it’s not all in one place, as it should be?

Harmony is able to merge and manage data from a wide array of sources and formats. This feature simplifies the task of aligning data for research purposes. Given the variety of data collection methods and formats used in modern research, it often happens that your data is all over the place.

Why is this important? Researchers often struggle with the task of merging data from different studies, because of the unique formats for questionnaires and data recording for each study or questionnaire (like one being in PDF format and another being an Excel sheet). Harmony eradicates this barrier and enables the smooth fusion of different data sources, which is important if you want to conduct a more thorough analysis.

## **9\. Compare Your Questionnaires from Different Studies**

Next up, let's talk about comparing questionnaires from different studies. How do you make sense of data from more than one study? You might have guessed it: Harmony has a feature that makes this easy and helpful. This step is great for seeing how your questions stack up against others. It helps you tweak and improve your questionnaire design.

With Harmony, you can look at the small details and differences in the questions used across various studies. This isn't just about spotting questions that are alike or pretty much the same. It's also about noticing questions that look similar but actually ask for different things or have opposite meanings. Understanding these differences is important for making sure your questionnaire is asking exactly what you intend and works well across different studies.

This feature is super useful for spotting how certain questions might work (or not work) in different places or among different groups of people. For example, in studies that involve more than one country or community, even small changes in how a question is asked can make a big difference in the answers you get.

## **10\. Leverage Expertise and Collaborative Support**
