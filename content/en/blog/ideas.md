## Ideas for future development of Harmony

* Add p-values in output
* Add integration with other LLMs such as GPT-3, GPT-4
* Add processing of negation in languages other than English and Portuguese
* Fix processing of PDFs (see our [Kaggle competition](/harmony-on-kaggle/))
* Integrate with UK Data Archive, UKLLC, and other repositories
