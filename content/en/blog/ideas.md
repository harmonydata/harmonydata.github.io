## Ideas for future development of Harmony

* Add p-values in output
* Add integration with other LLMs such as GPT-3, GPT-4
* Add processing of negation in languages other than English and Portuguese
* Fix processing of PDFs (see our [Kaggle competition](/harmony-on-kaggle/), also [issue](https://github.com/harmonydata/harmony/issues/11))
* Integrate with UK Data Archive, UKLLC, and other repositories
* Allow Harmony to process raw survey data so that social scientists have everything they need to run the statistical analyses
* Develop a feedback loop where users can handle bad matches
* Train a psychology specific model where Harmony predicts the similarity between items in the way that a factor model would quantify the similarity
