## Harmony launches on Kaggle!

We are proud to have launched our first competition on Kaggle!

The primary challenge of this competition is to develop a tool or method that can accurately extract questionnaire questions from documents, primarily PDFs.

This competition offers a unique opportunity for participants to contribute to the field of natural language processing and document analysis while developing solutions that have real-world applications. We encourage participants to think creatively, leverage available resources, and push the boundaries of current technologies.
