# **Unlocking Business Value through Master Data Harmonisation**

"The world is one big data problem." – Andrew McAfee, Co-director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. Indeed, data can turn into a significant problem when organizations don't know how to effectively manage and use it.

Today, businesses deal with a lot of data. If they don't handle this data well, it can become too much to manage. This can cause businesses to miss chances, work less efficiently, and make bad decisions.

This is why Master Data Management (MDM) is so important. MDM is all about creating, handling, and overseeing master data. Think of it as the foundation that guarantees that data throughout an organization is of high quality, consistent, and trustworthy.

It's interesting to see how much MDM is growing. This year, the MDM market is expected to be worth [about USD 15.33 billion](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/master-data-management-market#:~:text=The%20Master%20Data%20Management%20Market,period%20%282024%2D2029%29.). And it's not stopping there – it's predicted to jump to around USD 36.48 billion by 2029.

Why is MDM so important for businesses today? Well, it acts as the core for maintaining excellent data quality, which in turn supports good governance and adherence to regulations. It also paves the way for making informed decisions based on data.

What do businesses gain when they get MDM right and use the right software? Some have reported a remarkable improvement in their operations, with [efficiency gains of up to 20%](https://www.semarchy.com/blog/master-data-management-statistics-what-you-need-to-know/#footnotes)!

Incorporating MDM strategies doesn't just help with numbers, though. It transforms the way an organization interacts with its data. And in a world where data is king, having a reliable system to manage this vital resource is truly not just an option but a necessity.

How does your business handle its master data? Could improving your MDM be the key to unlocking even greater success?

## **What is Master Data Management (MDM)?**

Imagine MDM as the process of building and maintaining a trusted source for an organization's essential data. It's a bit like putting together a puzzle, where the pieces are stages like identifying, gathering, transforming, matching, merging, and sharing this master data across the business's data environment.

The impact of MDM can be seen in several ways. First off, it significantly boosts data quality. This means making sure that data is not only accurate but also consistent wherever it's used in the organization. In today's world, where data guides so many decisions, high-quality data is like gold. It's not just about having the correct figures and facts – it's about being able to trust those numbers wholeheartedly.

Then there's the aspect of data governance and compliance. Regulations like the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in Europe are a big deal. MDM plays a big role in making sure a business's data practices are compliant.

But perhaps the most exciting part? MDM leads to smart, effective decision-making. When business leaders have reliable and uniform data at their disposal, they can make choices that not only drive strategic plans but also enhance day-to-day operations. This facet of MDM is really something, as it directly touches on a company's success and its place in the market.

Isn't it fascinating how managing data well can make such a difference?

## **The Role of Data Harmonisation in MDM**

We can’t talk about MDM and not talk about data harmonisation. What is data harmonisation? Think of it as a process that seeks to create order and agreement among different data sets from various sources and systems within an organization.

Getting a grip on data harmonisation is a must for businesses that want to make the most of what MDM has to offer. But, what does this really mean?

- **Merging Varied Data Sources:** Picture an organization juggling data from a bunch of places – customer databases, product inventories, supplier details, you name it. These data sets can be as different as apples and oranges in terms of format, structure, and rules. Data harmonisation brings all these diverse data sets into a single, neat format.
- **Boosting Data Quality:** When you use data harmonisation techniques, what you're doing is cutting down on mix-ups and mistakes. It's all about making sure the master data is not just consistent everywhere but also dependable and free from mistakes. This step is key for making smart decisions based on data you can really trust.
- **Meeting Data Governance and Compliance:** Data harmonisation helps be in compliance with data governance standards. Handling data uniformly across the organization helps tick all those legal and ethical boxes.
- **Aiding Decision-Making:** Harmonised data offers a clearer, more complete picture of information. This clarity is vital for making strategic decisions. It helps businesses get accurate insights and analytics, leading to smarter, more effective strategies.
- **Simplifying Business Processes:** Last but not least, data harmonisation makes life easier in various business operations. It gets rid of the need to manually match up data, lowers the chance of errors, and increases operational efficiency.

## **Harmonisation Across Various Data Sources – Not Just SAP:**

When we talk about data harmonisation in the context of Master Data Management (MDM), it's not just a SAP story. It's about bringing together and syncing up data from all sorts of places. This involves making sure data is standardized, clean, and combined in a way that makes it consistent, accurate, and useful, no matter where you look.

In the world we live in today, organizations deal with masses of data from a bunch of different places. We're talking about CRM systems like Salesforce, financial tools like QuickBooks, and even unique systems built in-house. Data harmonisation can link these varied data worlds together for a more complete picture of info.

Here's the main goal: achieving what's known as a “single version of the truth.” This means, no matter if the data comes from SAP or some other system, it's tweaked to be universally understood and usable across the whole organization. This lets businesses make smarter choices, boost how well they operate, and even make their customers happier.

Imagine a scenario like this: You've got customer info in a CRM system and transaction details in an ERP system, like SAP. They might speak different languages, so to speak. This can be a big problem if you don’t know how to manage these different types of raw data to get meaningful results from your analysis. Harmonisation functions like a translator here – it helps make sure that these different data sets are speaking the same language and give a true and united view of customer interactions and transactions everywhere.

## **Using Harmonised Master Data for Business Value**

Harmonised master data is a powerful tool that can significantly influence and improve business decisions. It might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think about strategies to grow your business, but really, it should be up there.

Why? By providing a consistent, unified view of critical data elements like customers, products, suppliers, and employees, master data enables organisations to make informed, strategic decisions that drive business growth. Here are some more benefits so you can get a better idea of all the benefits:

- **360-Degree Customer Insights:** Master data paints a complete picture of your customers. To be successful, you need to know your target customer’s buying habits and preferences, their interests and their concerns. This knowledge leads to marketing magic, standout customer service, and, most importantly, loyal customers.
- **Streamlined Operations:** Imagine you could have all your data in one place, error-free. Operations would become smoother and more efficient – saving both time and money.
- **Informed Decisions:** With up-to-date, accurate data, forecasting and planning could become easier than ever. You can now easily identify trends, opportunities, and even risks.
- **Boosted Productivity:** Say goodbye to data silos and duplications! With harmonised master data, accessing reliable information is quick and easy, skyrocketing productivity.

## **What is Data Harmonisation in Mental Health Research?**

Ever wondered how [mental health](/ai-in-mental-health/) research makes sense of so much varied data – and how you can do the same for your research or business data? You start out with data that is all over the place: [different languages](/nlp-semantic-text-matching/harmony-on-kufungisisa-a-cultural-concept-of-distress-from-zimbabwe/), different formats and questions and scales. How do you get this data to reveal the answers you're looking for? The answer lies – once again – in data harmonisation.

You might be asking, “Isn’t that a long and tedious process? Do I need to harmonise my data manually?” The data harmonisation process can seem quite scary and overwhelming, as it traditionally requires extensive manual effort and meticulous attention to detail.

Don’t worry! [Harmony](https://harmonydata.ac.uk/) simplifies this process. Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) Harmony aligns questionnaire items from various countries (such as the GAD-7 anxiety questionnaire) and breaks down language barriers with ease. This smart fix means you no longer have to dread the data harmonisation process.

And data harmonisation isn't just about neat data. It's important for gaining clearer, deeper insights into mental health trends or business insights.

## **How to Use NLP for Questionnaire Harmonisation**

Let’s talk a little bit about Natural Language Processing. NLP is one of the essential technological advancements in data harmonisation, and Harmony utilises this technology to revolutionise how questionnaire data is harmonised.

How so? NLP enables Harmony to process and compare textual data from various questionnaires, identifying similarities, differences, and even nuanced relationships between items.

The data harmonisation process with NLP involves several steps:

1. You upload your questionnaire data (in formats like PDF or Excel) to the Harmony platform.
2. Harmony's NLP algorithms then analyse the text and map out similarities and differences across various questionnaires.
3. The system can identify identical questions, those with similar meanings, or even contrasting items. Thereby it creates a complete network graph for analysis.

This capability is particularly helpful and important in [multilingual settings](/nlp-semantic-text-matching/harmony-on-kufungisisa-a-cultural-concept-of-distress-from-zimbabwe/). For instance, Harmony can map the GAD-7 questionnaire used in the UK with its Brazilian Portuguese counterpart – for accuracy and relevancy in cross-cultural research.
