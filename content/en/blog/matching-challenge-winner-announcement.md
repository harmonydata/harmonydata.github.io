## It's all over!

*The Matching Challenge is now officially closed. Thank you to everyone who took part.*


The wait is over! We have now closed the Matching Challenge which was hosted on [DOXA AI](https://doxaai.com/competition/harmony-matching). Over the course of the competition we saw a total of 26 participants with 14 finalists making it onto the [scoreboard](https://doxaai.com/competition/harmony-matching/scoreboard). The final days were tense with many participants improving on their scores, submitting different methods and swapping places at the top of the scoreboard.

The final scoreboard:
