## Harmony at MQ and Datamind Data Science workshop

On 2 May 2025, Dr Eoin McElroy demonstrated Harmony at the MQ and Datamind Data Science workshop in Deutsche Bank. Eoin's presentation focused on "Maximising the use of existing survey data: facilitating cross-study research using retrospective harmonization." The workshop brought together researchers interested in applying novel harmonisation techniques to existing datasets.

Eoin explained traditional harmonisation processes and presented a user-friendly guide to the Harmony tool, demonstrating how natural language processing can streamline the harmonisation process. 

The agenda of the event was:

* Workshop title: Maximising the use of existing survey data: facilitating cross-study research using retrospective harmonization 
* Harmonised data - recap
* Retrospective harmonization using a content validation approach
* Retrospective harmonization using natural language processing: a guide to the Harmony tool
* Testing the equivalence of your harmonizaed data: a brief guide
* Harmonization exercise
