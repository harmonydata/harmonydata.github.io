## It's all over!

*The **Harmony Parsing Challenge on Doxa AI** has now closed. Thanks everyone for your submissions.*

We've now got our winners of the **Harmony Parsing Challenge**! The [top three submissions](https://doxaai.com/competition/harmony-parsing/scoreboard) all used the [DeBERTa model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/deberta).

* First place (accuracy of 93.145%): Aashvin Relwani (`@aashvin`)
* Second place (accuracy of 92.862%): Siddhant (`@siddhantoon`) 

We would like to give an honourable mention to Atharva (`@Gladiator`)  whose final scoreboard accuracy was 92.824% (but who made a submission with 92.914% accuracy roughly half an hour before the deadline)
