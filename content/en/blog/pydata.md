## Harmony at PyData London - 86th Meetup

**Update: you can download the slides from the presentation [here](/20240702-harmony-pydata-presentation.pdf)**

Topic: **NLP and generative models for psychology research**

Thomas Wood will present our work on Harmony, harmonydata.ac.uk, which is a [free online tool](/psychology-ai-tool/) that uses generative AI and LLMs to [help psychologists analyse datasets](/psychology-ai-tool/). It uses Python, Pandas and HuggingFace Sentence Transformers to [find similarities between questionnaires](/nlp-semantic-text-matching/).

* Psychologists and social scientists often have to match items in different questionnaires, such as "I often feel anxious" and "Feeling nervous, anxious or afraid".
* This is called [harmonisation](/data-harmonisation/).
* Harmonisation is a time consuming and subjective process.
* Going through long PDFs of questionnaires and putting the questions into Excel is no fun.
* We've been working on an [open source Python library](/open-source-for-social-science/) and free web tool called Harmony which uses natural language processing and generative AI models to help researchers [harmonise questionnaire items](/item-harmonisation/harmony-a-free-ai-tool-for-item-wise-harmonisation/), even [in different languages](/nlp-semantic-text-matching/harmony-on-kufungisisa-a-cultural-concept-of-distress-from-zimbabwe/).
