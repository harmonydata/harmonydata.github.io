Tabulating questionnaires and survey results is a crucial step in data analysis, providing insights into patterns, preferences, and trends among your respondents. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process, from understanding basic concepts to applying these principles through a practical exercise. By the end, you will be equipped with the knowledge to efficiently organize, analyze, and interpret your survey data.



## Introduction

Tabulation involves organizing and summarizing data in a structured format, usually in tables, to facilitate analysis. This process is essential for interpreting survey results, as it converts raw data into a form that is easier to understand and analyze.
Conducting surveys and questionnaires is a common practice in various fields such as market research, academic research, and social sciences. However, once the data is collected, it needs to be organized and analyzed effectively to derive meaningful insights. Tabulating survey results is a crucial step in this process. In this article, we will explore the importance of tabulation, methods for tabulating data, and provide a practice exercise to reinforce your understanding.


## Understanding Survey Data

{{< image src="/images/Understanding Survey Data.webp" alt="Understanding Survey Data" title="Understanding Survey Data" >}}

Before tabulating your data, it's crucial to understand the types of questions in your survey:

- **Closed-ended questions**: These are questions with a set list of responses. Examples include multiple choice, Yes/No, or rating scales.
- **Open-ended questions**: These solicit a free-form response from participants, providing qualitative data.


Survey data comes from questionnaires designed to gather information from specific groups of people about their opinions, behaviors, or characteristics. This data can be qualitative (non-numerical, text-based answers) or quantitative (numerical, measurable answers).

Tabulation transforms raw survey data into a summarized format, making it easier to analyze.

- **Frequency Distribution**: Counts the number of responses for each option in a question. Ideal for categorical data.
- **Cross-tabulation**: Compares the relationship between two or more variables. For example, you might cross-tabulate survey responses by gender to see if opinions differ significantly.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizes quantitative data with statistics such as mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation.

## Advanced Analysis

After basic tabulation, you may perform more sophisticated analyses, such as regression analysis, to explore relationships between variables, or factor analysis, to identify underlying factors in response patterns.


Now, Let's start having some hands-on with each steps of the tabulation process.

## Designing Your Questionnaire

Effective tabulation begins with well-designed questionnaires. Ensure questions are clear, concise, and relevant to your objectives. Decide in advance how you plan to tabulate and analyze responses, as this will influence question design (e.g., using Likert scales for attitudes, multiple choice for categorical data).


### Practical Exercise: Designing Your Questionnaire

Before we dive into the practical exercise for preparing survey data for tabulation, let's start by designing a questionnaire. For this exercise, we'll use a sample mental health survey to gather information about individual's mental well-being and coping mechanisms.

#### Sample Questions: 

1. **Demographic Information:**
   - Age: [Open-ended response]
   - Gender: [Male/Female/Non-binary/Prefer not to say]
   - Occupation: [Open-ended response]

2. **Mental Health Assessment:**
   - On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your overall mental well-being?
     - [Likert scale: 1 (Very poor) to 10 (Excellent)]
   - Have you ever been diagnosed with a mental health disorder? [Yes/No]
   - If yes, please specify the diagnosed disorder(s): [Open-ended response]
   - How often do you experience symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression?
     - [Multiple choice: Rarely/Sometimes/Often/Always]

3. **Coping Mechanisms:**
   - What strategies do you typically use to cope with stress, anxiety, or depression? (Check all that apply)
     - [Multiple choice: Exercise, Meditation, Therapy, Socializing, Hobbies, None, Other (please specify)]

4. **Additional Feedback:**
   - Is there anything else you would like to share about your mental health experiences? [Open-ended response]



Now, we have questions ready for collecting the raw data of the tabulations.

## Preparing Your Data for Tabulation

Before tabulating your data, it's crucial to ensure it's clean and organized. This involves several steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: The first step in tabulating your survey results is data cleaning. This involves checking the data for errors, inconsistencies, and missing values. For closed-ended questions, ensure that all responses fall within the expected range. For open-ended questions, check for and correct typos or categorize responses if necessary.

2. **Coding Open-ended Responses**: For open-ended questions, you'll need to code the responses. This means categorizing the answers into thematic groups or tags. For example, if you have a question about favorite fruits, you might categorize answers like "apple" and "banana" into a "fruits" category.

3. **Setting Up Your Data Structure**: Once your data is cleaned and coded, the next step is entering it into a spreadsheet or database. Each respondent should have their own row, and each question should have its own column. For closed-ended questions, you can enter the chosen option directly. For coded open-ended responses, enter the code or category you assigned.


### Practical Exercise: Preparing Your Data for Tabulation

Now, let's proceed with preparing the data for tabulation based on the sample mental health survey. We'll focus on cleaning the data and coding open-ended responses.

## Advanced Tabulation Techniques

1. **Weighting**: Adjust your data to reflect the importance of certain responses.
2. **Multivariate Analysis**: Use statistical software for complex analyses involving multiple variables.

### Practical Exercise

Apply weighting to your data if your sample doesn't accurately represent the population demographics. Then, conduct a simple regression analysis to investigate the impact of Mental health quality on overall well-being scores.

1. **Applying Weighting**: To calculate the weight in percentage using the provided formula, we need to determine the weight for each respondent as a percentage of the total weight. Here's how we can calculate it:

#### Calculate the total weight:
Sum of all the original overall well-being scores in the table.

Total Weight = 8 + 7 + 6 + 9 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 5 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 9 + 7 + 8 = 112


#### Calculate the weight for each respondent as a percentage of the total weight:
Weighted Score (%) = (Original Score / Total Weight) * 100

For each respondent, Weighted Overall Well-being (%) = (Overall Well-being / Total Weight) * 100


| Respondent ID | Age | Gender    | Occupation | Overall Well-being | Weighted Overall Well-being (%) |
|---------------|-----|-----------|------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|

This table shows the original overall well-being scores and their weighted counterparts for each respondent in the mental health survey data, expressed as a percentage of the total weight.



2. **Calculating Multivariate Analysis**: Now, let's conduct a simple regression analysis to investigate the impact of Mental health quality on overall well-being scores.


```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('mental_health_survey.csv')

# Assume weights are stored in a column named 'Weight'
weights = data['Weight']

# Select predictors and target variable
predictors = ['Age', 'Gender', 'Occupation', 'Overall Well-being']
target_variable = 'Overall Well-being'

# Apply weighting to the target variable
data[target_variable] = data[target_variable] * weights

# Create a subset of the data with selected variables
selected_data = data[predictors]

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(selected_data.drop(columns=[target_variable]), 
                                                    selected_data[target_variable], 
                                                    test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and fit linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict using the model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model performance
print('R-squared score:', model.score(X_test, y_test))

```

1. What is your gender? (Male/Female/Other)
2. What is your favorite subject? (Mathematics/Science/English/History/Other)

Using the provided data, create frequency distribution tables for each question and a cross-tabulation table to examine the relationship between gender and favorite subject.

**Survey Data:**

1. Gender:
   - Male: 45
   - Female: 55
   - Other: 5

2. Favorite Subject:
   - Mathematics: 30
   - Science: 25
   - English: 20
   - History: 15
   - Other: 10

**Frequency Distribution Table - Gender:**

| Gender | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Male   | 45        |
| Female | 55        |
