## Transforming data management with the Harmony Data Tool: A hands-on introduction

We're excited to be partnering with [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/) to deliver a practical workshop on how to best use our tools. The session will take place online on 29 November.

With live demonstrations of the Harmony Data Tool’s key functionalities, participants will leave with a clear understanding of how this tool can improve their data management processes which will help improve the efficiency and accuracy of longitudinal data analysis. [Sign up for the session](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/events/transforming-data-management-with-the-harmony-data-tool-a-hands-on-introduction/).

The session will be presented by Harmony project leaders: Bettina Moltrecht, PhD from the UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies at UCL, Eoin McElroy from Ulster University and Thomas Wood from Fast Data Science.
