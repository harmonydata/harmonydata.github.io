One common comparative analysis that psychologists encounter is comparing data collected with the CES-D vs data collected with the Beck Anxiety Inventory matchup. The CES-D (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression) questionnaire measures symptoms linked to depression, whereas the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) zeroes in on anxiety's cognitive and somatic signals. While both instruments address the similar theme of emotional distress, their unique parameters make it challenging to compare without meticulous harmonisation.
