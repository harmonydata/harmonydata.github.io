## Comparing CES-D vs SDQ using Harmony Software

Psychologists, social scientists, and researchers in related disciplines often grapple with the task of harmonizing elements or items from different questionnaires. This process can be time-consuming and subjective but is essential to meaningful analysis of longitudinal studies. Fortunately, there now exists an unparalleled solution to this challenge: Harmony software. One common comparison we come across is that between the CES-D and SDQ, two established measures of mental health. CES-D vs SD an arduous task, is now simplified by Harmony. Conceptualized from necessity, the Harmony software is designed to utilize natural language processing and generative AI models to harmonize questionnaire items. This can even be done across different languages. The idea takes a conventional task and turns it into a swift, streamlined process, allowing more time for actual research and less time on logistical complications.
