## Join the Harmony community on Discord!

Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/harmonydata)

We now have a Harmony channel on Discord.
Discord is an app that lets you text, chat, and communicate with others using video and audio (kind of like Skype). You can create a group chat for people who want to talk about the same general topic, or communicate with someone one-on-one. 

This is going to be a part of our community building project, as we are aiming to build up our thriving [open source](/open-source-for-social-science) community.

You can also follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harmony_data), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/harmonydata/about/?viewAsMember=true), and other social media channels.

The more people join, the higher our Discord will rank and the easier it is to bring more people on board the project!

## How can I improve Harmony?

There are a number of ways you can help to make this tool better for future users:

* If you're doing research and found Harmony useful, please [cite us](/ai-in-mental-health/bmc-psychiatry-paper/)!
* If you're a researcher trying to use the tool, and you encounter a problem, a bug, or a feature which you would like us to implement, please [raise an issue on Github](https://github.com/harmonydata/harmony) or [message us on Discord](https://discord.gg/harmonydata).
  * If you are able to fix the issue, please feel free to do that. You can submit your code back to the project by [making a pull request](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github-education/beginners-guide-to-github-merging-a-pull-request) but if you don't know how to do that, don't worry! You can always send us your work on Discord or by email.
* If you're a coder, feel free to contribute code to our repositories:
   * [Python](https://github.com/harmonydata/harmony) - the main core library and the Python package which is on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/harmonydata/)
   * [R](https://github.com/harmonydata/harmony_r) - the R port is on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/harmonydata/index.html) and it is slightly less mature than Python so we really appreciate if you can give the R package some TLC.
   * [API](https://github.com/harmonydata/harmonyapi) - the Python API runs with Pydantic and Fast API and is running on an on-prem server enabling the web app to work
   * [Web front end](https://github.com/harmonydata/app) - we welcome feedback and contributions on front end and UX issues
* You can always [message in Discord](https://discord.gg/harmonydata) and let us know that you're interested in joining the project.
* Please contribute to our [hackathons](/open-source-for-social-science/hackathon/) and [coding challenges](/doxa/) to help improve the tool
* We appreciate coming to give talks at events such as [Women In Data™️](/open-source-for-social-science/women-in-data/), [AI|DL](/psychology-ai-tool/aidl-meetup/), [MethodsCon Futures](/ai-in-mental-health/harmony-at-methodscon-futures/), [Pydata](/open-source-for-social-science/pydata-meetup/), [Lifecourse](/ai-in-mental-health/harmony-at-lifecourse-seminar/), and [AI Camp](/psychology-ai-tool/aicamp-meetup/). If you run a similar meetup or community group we are willing to come and talk.
* Please give feedback, no matter how informal. When we know how people are using the tool, this can help us improve it.
