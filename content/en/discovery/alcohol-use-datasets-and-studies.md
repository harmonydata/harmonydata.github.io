## Discover Alcohol Use datasets

Alcohol misuse is a public health concern globally, putting strain on medical systems and having significant consequences on an individual's personal life and health. Researchers looking to study this phenomenon have a new tool available: Harmony Discovery. This decision-making tool aids social scientists in finding datasets relating to a range of topics including Alcohol Use.

## Understanding Alcohol Use Datasets

Utilising Harmony Discovery, researchers can [discover comprehensive and insightful datasets](/discover-data/) by topic. These datasets offer a detailed look into different aspects of alcohol misuse, such as instances of alcohol demand, correlation with alcohol use disorder severity, effect of reward valuation and attentional bias on alcohol consumption, and firsthand interviews with women in early sobriety.

Here are a few examples of available datasets:

1. [Associations between the Brief Assessment of Alcohol Demand Questionnaire and Alcohol Use Disorder Severity in UK Samples of Student and Community Drinkers, 2019-2020](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/854564)

2. [Alcohol Seeking and Consumption: The Role of Reward Valuation and Attentional Bias](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/850737)

3. [Interviews with women in early sobriety 2019](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/854061)

## Longitudinal Studies

With Harmony Discovery, much of the featured datasets are longitudinal studies. These studies offer deeper insights as they allow for repeated observations of the same subjects, permitting a detailed analysis of change on an individual level over a certain period of time.

## Harmony's Unique Approach

Harmony uses advanced language models to match questionnaire items and variable names accurately. It connects with multiple data sources such as [UKLLC](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk), Closer, [The Catalogue of Mental Health Measures](https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/), [HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/), and [ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/), ensuring a comprehensive collection of datasets for researchers.
