## Alexithymia datasets and studies

*The Harmony team is working on Harmony Discovery, which will allow social scientists to find datasets about Alexithymia across data platforms. Harmony Discovery is due in 2025 and will extend the functionality of Harmony.*

## Discover Alexithymia Datasets with Harmony Discovery

Researchers interested in Alexithymia can find a broad range of data sets on Harmony Discovery. For those unfamiliar, Alexithymia is a condition characterized by difficulties in identifying, distinguishing, and articulating emotions. This condition is commonly found in autistic adults, who often struggle to self-report their emotional experiences to healthcare providers.

## What is Harmony Discovery?

Harmony Discovery is a tool designed to assist social sciences researchers in discovering datasets for longitudinal studies. This tool uses large language models to match questionnaire items and variable names, thereby making it easier for researchers to find and access relevant data. 

## Where Does Harmony Source Its Data?

The Harmony Discovery tool sources data from a broad range of archives. These include UKLLC, Closer, the Catalogue of Mental Health Measures, HDR UK, and ADR UK.

## Exploring Alexithymia Datasets 

Given the nuances associated with Alexithymia, the condition provides ample opportunities for complex and rich research. Beyond the challenge of mapping and understanding the emotional landscape of an individual experiencing Alexithymia, it's crucial to explore the practical implications, such as how these individuals interact with healthcare systems. 

Here are some examples of datasets Harmony can help researchers discover:

1. ***Deeply phenotyped sepsis patients within hospital:*** This dataset is beneficial for those interested in exploring the relationships between Alexithymia, sepsis, and treatment outcomes. 

2. ***NIHR BioResource: Full Blood Counts dataset:*** Biological data coupled with emotional profiling can provide invaluable insights into the biological factors contributing to or influenced by Alexithymia.

3. ***NT-proBNP in critically ill patients with sepsis: a NIHR Birmingham BRC Dataset:*** This dataset is useful for research focused on critically ill patients, allowing for a deeper exploration of the Alexithymia-sepsis connection.

In the quest to understand Alexithymia better, datasets such as these provide a treasure trove of insights. With Harmony Discovery, accessing these insights becomes profoundly simpler and quicker.
