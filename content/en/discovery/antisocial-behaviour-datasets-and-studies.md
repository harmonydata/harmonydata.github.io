## Antisocial Behaviour datasets and studies

*The Harmony team is working on Harmony Discovery, which will allow social scientists to find datasets about Antisocial Behaviour across data platforms. Harmony Discovery is due in 2025 and will extend the functionality of Harmony.*

## Discover Antisocial Behaviour Datasets with Harmony Discovery

As researchers, we often face the challenge of locating appropriate datasets for our studies, sorting through countless data points, and identifying those that align with our research objectives. One such area which demands this intricate process is the investigation of antisocial behaviour. This is where Harmony Discovery comes into play.

Harmony Discovery is a discovery tool designed for researchers in the social sciences, aimed at assisting in the discovery of datasets about longitudinal studies, by topic, including antisocial behaviour. With Harmony, you can zero in on specific datasets that are most relevant to your work, saving time and resources.

## How does Harmony Discovery work?

Harmony utilises large language models to match questionnaire items and variable names. It excels at connecting researchers with a plethora of data sources like [UKLLC](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk), [Closer](https://www.closer.ac.uk/), the [Catalogue of Mental Health Measures](https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/), [HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/) and [ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/). 

For example, let's say you're interested in [antisocial](/discover-data/antisocial-personality-disorder-aspd-datasets-and-studies) behaviour. Harmony will scour datasets across these sources and return options that align with your search. Each dataset includes a description of the data, its source, and a link to the dataset for easy access. You can conveniently jump straight to the data you need, bypassing the need to sift through irrelevant datasets.

## Unpacking Antisocial Behaviour Datasets

Here are some examples of the kind of datasets Harmony Discovery can help you find related to antisocial behaviour:

1. [An experiment on individual ‘parochial altruism’ revealing no connection between individual ‘altruism’ and individual ‘parochialism’.](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/852931)

2. [The effects of in-group relations on the spread of aggression: Study 3, 2016-2019.](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/853847)

3. [The role of social identity on the 'contagious' transmission of scratching behaviour: Study 1, 2016-2018.](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/853785)

[Longitudinal studies](/item-harmonisation/harmony-a-free-ai-tool-for-longitudinal-study/), which make repeated observations of the same subjects, are particularly enlightening when analysing change at the individual level. Harmony Discovery can be instrumental in finding datasets relevant to these types of studies.

Metadata, the information about data, can sometimes be overwhelming to navigate. But Harmony Discovery simplifies this process and offers an easy-to-use interface for researchers of all kinds. Whether you're diving into an investigation of antisocial behaviour, or exploring a different field within social sciences, Harmony Discovery can make the initial steps in your research project much smoother.
