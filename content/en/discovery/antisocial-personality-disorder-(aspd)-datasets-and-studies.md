## Discover Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) Datasets

Antisocial Personality Disorder is a mental health condition that significantly impacts how individuals perceive, think, feel, and relate to others. It's marked by reckless, irresponsible, manipulative, and often criminal behavior. Unearthing more data about this disorder is a critical step toward understanding and addressing it better.

This is where **Harmony Discovery** steps in - a tool designed to facilitate the exploration of longitudinal studies about various topics, including Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD). 

## How researchers can utilize Harmony Discovery

Harmony Discovery uses sophisticated large language models to match questionnaire items and variable names. This allows researchers to pinpoint the exact information they're looking for, saving time and effort usually spent scouring data sources.

Connected to a plethora of data sources, including [UKLLC](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk), Closer, the Catalogue of Mental Health Measures, [HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/) and [ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/) - Harmony opens the door to a comprehensive reservoir of datasets related to ASPD.
