## Discover Anxiety Datasets with Harmony Discovery

As the need for rich, accurate data escalates in the field of mental health, researchers are finding powerful allies in tools like [Harmony Discovery](https://harmonydata.ac.uk). Harmony offers a streamlined process to discover and access diverse datasets crucial for studies involving anxiety and related conditions. 

Harmony Discovery is a sophisticated tool that leverages large language model capabilities to match questionnaire items, variable names, usually scattered across different data repositories. This enhanced capability ensures relevant and focused data sets related to anxiety are easily available for researchers to utilize.

## Bringing Anxiety Dataset at Your Fingertips

Harmony is your gateway to a broad range of data sources - an extensive collection that includes but is not restricted to, the UKLLC ([UK?s Longitudinal Linked Census](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk)), [Closer](https://www.closer.ac.uk/), the [Catalogue of Mental Health Measures](https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/), [HDR UK (Health Data Research UK)](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/) and [ADR UK (Administrative Data Research UK)](https://www.adruk.org/).

Let's look at a few anxiety-related datasets gathered through Harmony's efficient data collation:

1. [Beyond Self-Report: A Multi-Method Approach to Characterising Intolerance of Uncertainty, 2018-2021 (855063)](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/855063) - This project explores daily uncertainties and their effects on stress levels.

2. [Maternal Depression and Anxiety Disorders: Longitudinal Secondary Data Analysis, 2020-2022 (856044)](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/856044) - This research focuses on the influence of maternal depression and anxiety disorders (MDAD) on children's mental health.
