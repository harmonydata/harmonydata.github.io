# Discover Asperger's Syndrome datasets with Harmony Discovery

Welcome to a brand new era in social science research with Harmony Discovery, an intuitive tool that aids researchers in unearthing datasets on various topics, including Asperger's Syndrome. Let's delve into how you can utilize Harmony to explore datasets on this Autism Spectrum Disorder.

## A wealth of data at your fingertips

Harmony connects to multiple data sources, including [UKLLC](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk), [Closer](https://www.closer.ac.uk), [Catalogue of Mental Health Measures](https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/), [HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/), and [ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/). Through its expansive network, Harmony provides access to numerous datasets examining Asperger's Syndrome. Accessible datasets offer insights into a range of areas, including conversational alignments, profiles of savants, and even eyewitness accounts by adults with autism.

## Longitudinal data at the core of research

Distinctive to Harmony, it concentrates on longitudinal studies that allow repeated observations of the same subjects over time. The value of longitudinal data is in understanding the unmatched depth it allows in evaluating individual transformation over time. 

Harmony services social science researchers by assisting in finding datasets with longitudinal data on Asperger's Syndrome. For example, these datasets include:

- [Conversational Alignment in Children with an Autistic Spectrum Condition and Typically Developing Children, 2017-2022](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/855583/)
- [Savants, autism spectrum conditions and control profile data 2013-2016](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/853449/)
- [Eyewitness testimony by adults with autism spectrum disorder](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/851109/)

Each of these studies reveals detailed insights into different aspects of Asperger's Syndrome, enabling researchers to infer change over time.

## Harnessing vast language models to refine search

Harmony leverages sizeable language models to match questionnaire items and variable names, thereby refining the search for data and making it more relevant to the researchers' needs.

## Wrapping it up

When it comes to exploring datasets on Asperger's Syndrome, Harmony Discovery stands as an invaluable tool. With longitudinal data from various substantial sources, paired with advanced language models, researchers can enhance their studies on Asperger's Syndrome.

So whether you're looking to investigate conversational alignment in children with [autism](/discover-data/autism-datasets-and-studies), grasp the world of savants, or comprehend how adults with autism far as eyewitnesses, Harmony paves the way, making your data discovery journey seamless.
