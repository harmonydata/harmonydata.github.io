## Attachment Disorders datasets and studies

*The Harmony team is working on Harmony Discovery, which will allow social scientists to find datasets about Attachment Disorders across data platforms. Harmony Discovery is due in 2025 and will extend the functionality of Harmony.*

## Discover Attachment Disorders Datasets with Harmony Discovery

For researchers interested in exploring Attachment Disorders, finding the appropriate datasets can be a formidable task. However, Harmony Discovery simplifies the process, offering a powerful tool for discovering longitudinal studies on a range of topics, including Attachment Disorders. 

Studies of Attachment Disorders often require the analysis of repeated observations of the same subjects. This type of research, known as longitudinal studies, can be crucial in understanding how these disorders develop and progress over time.

Harmony Discovery is linked with an array of data sources from across the globe. These include the [UKLLC](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk), [Closer](https://www.closer.ac.uk/), the Catalogue of Mental Health Measures ([CMHM](https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/)), [HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/) and [ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/). Through these connections, Harmony Discovery provides access to a vast range of data assets for researchers. 

One example of the type of dataset available on Harmony Discovery is called 'The Impact of Early Experiences on Empathy Development: Markers of Vulnerability and Resilience, 2020-2021' available [here](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/855404). This study looks at how maltreatment in early childhood stages can impact the development of empathy, a factor which can potentially lead to Attachment Disorders.

Another related dataset, 'Associations between Childhood Maltreatment and Peer Relationships: the Role of Empathy, 2020-2021', focuses on peer relationships and the social consequences of childhood maltreatment, accessible [here](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/855445). 

As a step forward towards digital transformation in research, Harmony Discovery uses large language models to ascertain correlations between questionnaire items and variable names. This enables researchers to obtain a more detailed, nuanced understanding of the appropriate datasets for their intended research.
