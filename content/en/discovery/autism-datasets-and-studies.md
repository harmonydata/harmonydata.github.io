## Discover Autism Datasets with Harmony Discovery

Researchers within the fields of social science, mental health, and healthcare often need quick access to rich, accurate, and related research datasets to aid their research process. If you're conducting research on Autism, Harmony Discovery is a tool that you should consider incorporating into your research armory. 

Harmony Discovery is a powerful platform that helps researchers conveniently dive into extensive datasets about various longitudinal studies, with one of them being Autism. It banks on advanced large language models to juxtapose questionnaire items and variable names, making it easier for researchers to locate the precise data they're looking for.
