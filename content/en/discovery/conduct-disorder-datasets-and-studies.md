## Conduct Disorder datasets and studies

*The Harmony team is working on Harmony Discovery, which will allow social scientists to find datasets about Conduct Disorder across data platforms. Harmony Discovery is due in 2025 and will extend the functionality of Harmony.*

## Discover Conduct Disorder Datasets with Harmony Discovery

Conduct Disorder (CD) is a serious behavioral and emotional disorder that can occur in children and teenagers. This disorder is marked by a pattern of disruptive and violent behavior in which the child or teenager violates the basic rights of others. Understanding CD and its impacts requires extensive research with robust, quality data. 

Fortunately, Harmony Discovery is an invaluable tool designed to aid researchers in discovering and accessing datasets related to a wide range of topics, including Conduct Disorder. 

## Unearthing Data with Harmony Discovery 

Harmony Discovery relies on advanced large language models to match questionnaire items and variable names, facilitating the discovery of relevant datasets. It reveals data sets not just related to Conduct Disorder, but also about families' experiences with different mental illnesses, comorbidity of substance misuse and mental health problems, and inpatient and day case mental health records. 

## Longitudinal Studies and Conduct Disorder 

A key feature of Harmony Discovery is its access to longitudinal studies which involves repeated observations of the same subjects, allowing researchers to study change at the individual level. By examining datasets over time, researchers can more accurately observe the development, progression, and effects of Conduct Disorder on individuals in real-world contexts. 

## Connected to Major Data Sources 

Harmony is seamlessly connected to several major data sources, which include: 

- [UKLLC](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk): A platform that provides access to resources about longitudinal studies conducted in the UK.
- [Closer](https://www.closer.ac.uk/): A platform designed to maximise the use, value and impact of longitudinal studies.
- [Catalogue of Mental Health Measures](https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/): A compendium of mental health measures used in various studies.
