## Discover Eating Disorders Datasets Using Harmony Discovery

If you're a researcher in the area of social sciences and are interested in studying Eating Disorders, finding the right datasets to power your investigation is key. Access to rich, in-depth data can significantly enhance the quality of your research. This is where Harmony Discovery comes in.

Harmony Discovery is an advanced tool designed to assist researchers in finding datasets for longitudinal studies - studies that involve observing the same subjects over a period of time to analyze changes at the individual level. In the case of Eating Disorders, Harmony is a lifesaver, helping researchers discover datasets that offer insights into these conditions over a given timeframe.

Harmony has learned to match variable names and questionnaire items with datasets, using sophisticated large language models. This allows for better context and reference points on the given subject, enabling a more profound and nuanced exploration of the topic at hand.

## Powerful Connections for Robust Data

Harmony is connected to several data repositories including the UKLLC ([UKLLC](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk)), Closer, the Catalogue of Mental Health Measures ([Catalogue of Mental Health](https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/)), HDR UK ([HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/)), and ADR UK ([ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/)). 

These connections place a wealth of information at the fingertips of researchers. For instance, datasets such as 'Eating Together: Effects of the Social Context of Eating on Appetite, 2018-2021' investigate the social aspect of eating and its impact on food intake—a critical aspect when examining Eating disorders.

Another dataset, 'The relationship between parental feeding practices and neural responses to food cues in adolescents', provides understanding around the influence of parental feeding habits on their teenage children’s eating behaviors, feeding directly into the research on adolescent eating disorders.

## In Summary

Datasets such as 'Concepts of Healthy Eating Food Research: Phases I and II, 1992-1996' also provide an anthropological view of the relationship between food choices and health, providing an intersectional exploration of the topic.
