## Discover Emotional Problems Datasets with Harmony Discovery

Dealing with emotional problems is a crucial aspect of social sciences, and the need for high-quality datasets to study this field of research is ever-growing. Thanks to Harmony Discovery, finding these datasets just got easier!

Harmony Discovery is an intuitive tool specifically designed to help researchers discover datasets about various topics, including emotional problems. This tool utilises advanced large language models to match questionnaire items and variable names, making it easier and more efficient for research analysts to find the datasets they need.

## What Can Harmony Discovery Do?

Researchers can delve into emotional problems data within a few clicks. You can explore datasets that focus specifically on emotional problems from different perspectives. For example, you could explore data from a survey on attitudes towards Emotional AI in the UK (**source [856708](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/856708)**), a study investigating the role of negative emotions on error and non-compliance (**source [853775](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/853775)**), or a project about the emotion regulation of others and self (**source [850637](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/850637)**).

## Longitudinal Studies

What sets Harmony Discovery apart is its focus on longitudinal studies, which involve repeated observations of the same subjects, allowing for thorough analyses of changes at the individual level over time. What may otherwise be seen as a needle in a haystack becomes intuitive and straightforward with Harmony Discovery's dataset exploration features.
