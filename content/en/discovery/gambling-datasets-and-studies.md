## Discover Gambling Datasets with Harmony Discovery

In the field of social sciences, the study of gambling is essential to understanding its effects, risks, and societal particulars. Access to accurate and diverse datasets on gambling is crucial for carrying out high-quality research in this area. This is where **Harmony Discovery** plays an integral role. 

## What is Harmony Discovery?

Harmony Discovery is a novel tool designed to facilitate the process of finding longitudinal datasets for social science research. Longitudinal studies involve repeated observations of the same subjects over time and provide valuable insights into patterns and changes. 

Harmony Discovery leverages large language models that recognise variable names and questionnaire items in a dataset, which makes it highly effective at matching topics to applicable studies. It is connected to several reliable data sources, such as [UKLLC](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk), [Closer](https://www.closer.ac.uk/), [the Catalogue of Mental Health Measures](https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/), [HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/), and [ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/).
