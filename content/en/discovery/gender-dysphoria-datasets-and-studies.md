## Discover Gender Dysphoria Datasets with Harmony Discovery

Research into gender dysphoria – the distress a person feels due to a mismatch between their gender identity and their sex assigned at birth – is growing exponentially, adding to our understanding of the many factors at play. Accompanying this research boom is a significant increase in relevant data sets. For researchers, finding and understanding these datasets is crucial. Thanks to innovative platforms like Harmony Discovery, unearthing this crucial information has become increasingly efficient and accurate.

## What is Harmony Discovery?

Harmony Discovery is an advanced tool developed primarily for researchers in the social sciences. The platform operates via large language models that identify questionnaire items and match variable names, making it easier for researchers to find datasets relevant to their studies, including those related to gender dysphoria.

## Source Integration

Harmony boasts a comprehensive and expansive reach, sourcing data from various platforms such as the UKLLC, Closer, the Catalogue of Mental Health Measures, HDR UK, and ADR UK. By [pooling](/item-harmonisation/harmony-a-free-ai-tool-for-data-pooling) resources from these multiple sources, Harmony grants researchers access to a vast pool of valuable information.

## User-friendly Functionality

The intuitive design of Harmony Discovery allows researchers to effortlessly browse and analyse longitudinal study datasets. Longitudinal studies, which entail repeated observations of the same subjects over time, are invaluable when studying individual-level changes which is common in gender dysphoria research. Harmony Discovery's design tailors specifically to this research model, facilitating efficient data discovery and extraction.
