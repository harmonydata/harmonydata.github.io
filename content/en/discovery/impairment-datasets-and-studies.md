## Discover Impairment Datasets with Harmony Discovery

Harmony Discovery is an innovative tool designed for social science researchers to discover datasets related to specific topics such as Impairment. It is a platform that connects to various data sources including the UKLLC, Closer, the Catalogue of Mental Health Measures, HDR UK, and ADR UK. 

Whether you are researching developmental disorders of arithmetical ability in children, the psychological and social problems of teenagers with congenital cerebral palsy or spina bifida with hydrocephalus, or seeking answers from the Disability Supplemental Questions Dataset, Harmony Discovery can help.

Harmony Discovery employs large language models to match variable names and questionnaire items in the datasets. It is particularly useful for longitudinal studies as it facilitates repeated observations of the same subjects, enabling researchers to analyse the changes at an individual level over time. 

An example of a few datasets available on Impairment include:

* **Dataset 3967**: A longitudinal study of children with developmental disorders of arithmetical ability, the project provides insights into the disproportionate difficulty in the acquisition of arithmetical facts and tables among children of normal intelligence with no known medical history of relevance.

* **Dataset 2264**: This dataset provides a comprehensive perspective on the psychological and social difficulties faced by teenagers with congenital cerebral palsy or spina bifida with hydrocephalus. It aims at understanding the factors associated with their adjustment and assesses the adequacy of available services.

* **Dataset 1989**: If you're investigating more general data on disability, this Disability Supplemental Questions Dataset offers a wealth of information.
