With the rising prevalence of mental health disorders, it has never been more crucial to have accessibility to comprehensive datasets for research purposes. Harmony Discovery, a revolutionary tool for social science researchers, helps in uncovering datasets about longitudinal studies on various topics, including Mental Illness. 

Harmony Discovery leverages the power of advanced language models to match questionnaire items and variable names. By doing so, it saves researchers considerable time and effort by offering an easy and efficient way to find the precise datasets they need for their studies.

## Datasets at your fingertips

For instance, Harmony has a dataset titled 'Supporting Mental Health in Schools and Colleges' which reveals valuable insights about the mental health status of children and young people in the UK. According to this dataset, it is estimated that one in ten students have a diagnosable mental disorder. Comprehensive data like this is crucial for researchers and policymakers alike, to better understand and address the issue of mental health in young people.

Another dataset available through Harmony is the 'Multi-modal Open Dataset for Mental-disorder Analysis'. This set provides valuable information about the increasing prevalence of mental disorders, especially depression.
