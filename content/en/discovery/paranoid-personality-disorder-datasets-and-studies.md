## Paranoid Personality Disorder datasets and studies

*The Harmony team is working on Harmony Discovery, which will allow social scientists to find datasets about Paranoid Personality Disorder across data platforms. Harmony Discovery is due in 2025 and will extend the functionality of Harmony.*

## Discover Paranoid Personality Disorder Datasets with Harmony Discovery

Paranoid Personality Disorder (PPD) is an often misunderstood and under-researched topic in the mental health field. In the age of big data, valuable insights into PPD can be gleaned from longitudinal studies, involving repeated observations of individuals over time. The challenge lies in discovering these datasets. Enter [Harmony Discovery](/discovery), a powerful tool designed to aid social sciences researchers in their quest for pertinent datasets, including those related to PPD.

## The Power of Harmony Discovery

Aiming to streamline the process of data discovery, Harmony uses large language models that leverage machine learning techniques to match questionnaire items, and variable names to the researcher's topic of interest. 

As a result, searching for and sourcing datasets become more efficient and accurate. Harmony's database is connected to several reputable data sources including the [UKLLC](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/), [Closer](https://www.closer.ac.uk/), the [Catalogue of Mental Health Measures](https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/), [HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/), and [ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/).

## Spotlight on Paranoid Personality Disorder

To showcase the strength of Harmony Discovery, we examine three distinct datasets focused on topics relevant to PPD:

- **Dataset 853978**: [Cognitive bias modification for paranoia, feasibility study: Main and interim datasets 2015-2017](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/853978/). This investigated the feasibility of a cognitive intervention for clinical paranoia, compared to a control group engaging in regular text reading.

- **Dataset 851072**: [Mechanisms of catastrophic worrying](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/851072/). This study sought to comprehend why individuals with anxiety disorders (often coinciding with PPD) retain bouts of worry despite the distress it invokes.
  
- **Dataset 850487**: [Mental Control and the Self: Ironic Effects of Thought Suppression on the Perception, Behaviour, and Memory of the Self](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/850487/). This explores the impact of suppressed thoughts on the perception, behavioural tendencies, and memory of the self, aspects often altered in PPD individuals.

Each dataset can provide invaluable insights into the patterns, cognitive biases, and mechanisms associated with PPD and its related conditions.

By implementing tools like Harmony Discovery, researchers navigating the vast seas of data can significantly expedite their exploration process while ensuring robust investigation into critical topics like PPD. The harmonisation of data discovery is the future of social sciences research, and it is available now, ready to be harnessed.
