## Discover Psychological Wellbeing Datasets

Renowned academic researchers, budding scholars or passionate data enthusiasts who are delving into the field of Psychological Wellbeing need reliable and comprehensive datasets to carry out meaningful studies. Harmony Discovery is a perfect tool that helps in unveiling these valuable assets.

Harmony Discovery facilitates a one-stop-shop for researchers in the social sciences to find datasets related to longitudinal studies. These are unique studies that involve repeated observations of the same subjects over time. Such data is invaluable to researchers studying Psychological Wellbeing as it enables them to analyse changes at the individual level, thereby gaining deep insights into the dynamics of psychological health in diverse populations.

Harmony leverages large language models to match questionnaire items and variable names, significantly simplifying and enhancing the research process for social scientists. This innovative tool is connected to multiple reputable data sources, including the UKLLC, Closer, the Catalogue of Mental Health Measures, HDR UK, and ADR UK.

Among the versatile datasets available, the "Wellbeing in Developing Countries" series is a remarkable resource. Comprising data collected between 2003 and 2006, these studies aim to understand the socio-cultural construction of wellbeing in developing countries. The strategic collaboration between different departments of the University of Bath helps share extensive knowledge and expertise in the fields of Economics, International Development, Social and Political Sciences, thus providing a multidimensional perspective of the concept of wellbeing.
