## Discover Psychosis and Schizophrenia Datasets with Harmony Discovery

If you're conducting research within the social sciences, especially on issues concerning mental health such as psychosis and schizophrenia, locating relevant datasets can sometimes be a challenging task. However, a tool such as Harmony Discovery makes the process easier and more efficient.

Harmony Discovery is a robust tool designed to support researchers by providing a simple way to discover datasets on particular subjects. The tool uses highly advanced large language models to match questionnaire items and variable names, thereby providing you with precisely the kind of data you need for your investigation.

## Accessing Rich Datasets on Psychosis and Schizophrenia

For researchers interested specifically in psychosis and schizophrenia datasets, you'll find Harmony Discovery to be of immense value. Below, we highlight three datasets currently available:

1. **National Audit of Psychosis - Audit on Early Intervention in Psychosis services - patient experience survey:** This dataset provides in-depth insights into patients' experiences, sampled over a year, providing detailed patient experiences under different treatment conditions.

2. **National Audit of Psychosis - Audit on Early Intervention in Psychosis services - case note audit:** Researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of different treatment interventions like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Psychosis, physical health screenings, and more. 

3. **National Audit of Psychosis - Audit on Early Intervention in Psychosis services - contextual data:** A dataset that houses organisational survey data about EIP services, their staffing, the data they collect about their service and caseload.

## Harnessing the Power of Longitudinal Studies

Harmony Discovery also opens the door to longitudinal studies. These studies involve repeated observations of the same subjects over time, a methodology that enhances the accuracy and reliability of the data collected. This continuous monitoring allows researchers to analyze changes at the individual level, crucial for understanding conditions like psychosis and schizophrenia.

## Widespread Data Connection

One key feature that sets Harmony Discovery apart is its connection to multiple data sources. It's closely tethered to data platforms like the UKLLC, Closer, the Catalogue of Mental Health Measures, HDR UK, and ADR UK. This widespread connection ensures that researchers have access to the most extensive possible range of datasets.
