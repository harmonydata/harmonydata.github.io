## PTSD datasets and studies

*The Harmony team is working on Harmony Discovery, which will allow social scientists to find datasets about PTSD across data platforms. Harmony Discovery is due in 2025 and will extend the functionality of Harmony.*

## Discover PTSD Datasets with Harmony Discovery

Uncovering critical insights about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and the variation of its impact on individuals over time is crucial for healthcare and social science professionals. In such a scenario, having access to the right datasets can be like striking gold.

Harmony Discovery is a powerful tool for researchers seeking datasets about longitudinal studies on PTSD - it's an advanced data discovery platform that employs large language models to match questionnaire items and variable names in a highly accurate manner. The main purpose? To guide researchers to the right dataset to observe and analyse subjects over an extended period and understand the developmental and behavioral changes associated with PTSD.

## Notable Features of Harmony Discovery

Harmony Discovery is connected to a wide array of data sources. These include:

- UK Longitudinal Collections (https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk)
- Closer
- Catalogue of Mental Health Measures (https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/)
- Health Data Research UK (https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/)
- Administrative Data Research UK (https://www.adruk.org/)

These are vast repositories of global data on longitudinal studies and health measures, and Harmony's reach across them greatly aids in unearthing relevant insights about PTSD.

## Examples of datasets

For instance, datasets like the "Radiotherapy Dataset (RTDS)" and "Referral to Treatment Times (RTTD)" contain clinically relevant identification and activity data from medical facilities. This data could help researchers understand the correlation between certain treatments and the progression/improvement of PTSD symptoms over time.

What makes Harmony Discovery particularly useful is its ability to facilitate routine collection of clinically and managerially relevant data, so that Radiotherapy Services, for example, can be commissioned or monitored in an evidence-based manner.
