## Self Harm and Suicide datasets and studies

*The Harmony team is working on Harmony Discovery, which will allow social scientists to find datasets about Self Harm and Suicide across data platforms. Harmony Discovery is due in 2025 and will extend the functionality of Harmony.*

## Discover Self Harm and Suicide Datasets Using Harmony Discovery

Harmony Discovery is an AI-powered tool that enables researchers, particularly in social sciences, to explore a wealth of datasets on various topics, including those on Self Harm and Suicide. Whether you are conducting a small research study or a comprehensive review, the tool makes it easier to discover data that can help answer your research questions.

Currently, data is sourced from broad platforms such as [UKLLC](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk), [Closer](https://www.closer.ac.uk/), [Mental Health Measures Catalogue](https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/), [HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/) and [ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/).

Let's look at how Harmony Discovery simplifies the process of discovering self harm and suicide datasets.

## How Does Harmony Discovery Work?

Harmony makes use of large language models to match survey items and variable names, ensuring greater accuracy in filtering research data. To generate relevant results, the user enters a keyword or phrase – in this case, 'self harm' or 'suicide'.

An example of its effective dataset discovery is observed with the following datasets:

- [Development and Validation of the Suicidal Behaviours Questionnaire - Autism Spectrum Conditions and the Autistic Depression Assessment Tool - Adult, 2018-2019](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/855053)
- [Experiences of Bereavement and Self-harm among Adolescents in Scotland, 2019-2020](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/855079)
- [The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide in Autistic and Non-autistic Adults, 2019](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/856639)

What makes these datasets exceptional is the quality and type of data that they offer — qualitative, quantitative, and mix-method data, as well as longitudinal studies that include repeated observations of the same subjects over time.

## The Importance of Harmony Discovery

With Harmony Discovery, researchers can conveniently find datasets and valuable information dealing with sensitive topics such as self harm and suicide. This enhances their ability to understand these complex issues from various angles and to develop interventions based on a combination of qualitative insights and quantitative measures.

Broadly speaking, the platform encourages research that can produce meaningful insights and action plans that could ultimately lead to the prevention of self harm and suicide.

In a nutshell, Harmony Discovery is a game-changer for researchers in the social sciences. Its capabilities not only streamline the research process but also open up greater possibilities for significant discoveries.
