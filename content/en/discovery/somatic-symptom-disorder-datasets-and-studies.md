## Discover Somatic Symptom Disorder Datasets with Harmony Discovery

Harmony Discovery is a powerful tool that researchers can use to explore datasets related to Somatic Symptom Disorder, a prevalent and often challenging to understand mental health condition. This tool is particularly well suited for identifying longitudinal studies, which involve repeated observations of the same subjects over time. 

## What is Somatic Symptom Disorder?

Somatic Symptom Disorder is a [mental health](/ai-in-mental-health/) disorder characterized by an extreme focus on physical symptoms, such as pain or fatigue, causing major emotional distress and problems functioning. The person has excessive thoughts, feelings or behaviors related to the physical symptoms. The symptoms can be related to any part of the body and can widely vary in their severity.

## Using Harmony Discovery for Research

Harmony Discovery uses extensive language models to match questionnaire items and variable names, allowing researchers to find targeted and specific data regarding Somatic Symptom Disorder. Harmony is connected to multiple data sources, including the [UKLLC](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk), Closer, the [Catalogue of Mental Health Measures](https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/), [HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/) and [ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/). 

Research data regarding Somatic Symptom Disorder can be found in various databases. For instance, you can access a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating attentional bias for painful and non-painful somatosensory stimuli in individuals with chronic pain from the [UK Data Service Reshare](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/854482). There's also Scotland's Mental Health Inpatient and Day Case dataset and a dataset containing demographic risk factors, biomarkers, and physiological data for Acute Compartment Syndrome. 

## The Value of Longitudinal Studies

Longitudinal studies are particularly informative for researchers as they allow changes to be analysed at an individual level, yielding detailed and nuanced findings. Such studies provide valuable insights into the progression of Somatic Symptom Disorder and can be crucial for determining effective interventions or therapies.
