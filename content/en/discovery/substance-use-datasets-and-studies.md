## Substance Use datasets and studies

*The Harmony team is working on [Harmony Discovery](https://harmonydiscovery.fastdatascience.com/), which will allow social scientists to find datasets about Substance Use across data platforms. [Harmony Discovery](https://harmonydiscovery.fastdatascience.com/) is due in 2025 and will extend the functionality of Harmony.*

## Discover Substance Use Datasets with Harmony Discovery

As researchers within the social and medical sciences fields may be aware, gaining access to vast datasets can be a catalyst for leading-edge research. In the field of Substance Use particularly, understanding the patterns and correlations observed in large datasets is important for research and societal impact. A game-changing tool available for these researchers is Harmony Discovery, which presents a robust means to discover datasets related to Substance Use.

Related to longitudinal studies, Harmony Discovery facilitates repeated observations of the same subjects. This allows researchers to delve into individual changes over time, diving deeper into the journey a substance user emotionally and physically travels through. The tool employs sophisticated language models, correlating questionnaire items and variable names to ensure accurate and robust findings.

Harmony teems with substance use datasets from prestigious sources such as Closer, the UKLLC, ADR UK, the Catalogue of Mental Health Measures, and HDR UK. For instance, researchers can explore the Substance Misuse Dataset (SMDS), which provides comprehensive information about substance misuse treatment for individuals (both adults and young persons) in Wales.

In another study, researchers have examined the intersection of pregnancy and substance misuse, including two main research domains: how pregnant substance-misusing women and their foetuses are assessed and monitored, and how these women respond to the treatment offered, as well as the supervision of their pregnancies. 

Additionally, researchers can examine categorised medication use, a crucial component of substance use studies. 

To summarise, Harmony Discovery is not just a tool; it's an enabler of world-changing research. It offers a unique opportunity for researchers to explore available datasets, delve deep into hidden correlations, and bring to life transformative findings in the field of Substance Use. So, whether your research needs an impetus or you're embarking on a new journey in your studies, Harmony Discovery can be your trusted companion.
