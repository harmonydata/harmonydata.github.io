## Discover Tobacco Use Datasets with Harmony Discovery

Exploring the origins, prevalence, and effects of tobacco use has occupied significant effort in the social sciences. The incorporation of longitudinal studies to this end offers an insightful window into the evolution of individual tobacco use patterns. Luckily, for researchers in this area, tools like Harmony Discovery are revolutionizing how appropriate datasets are discovered.

Harmony Discovery is a highly innovative tool designed with the fundamental task of helping social science researchers find datasets relevant to their subject of interest. Notably, this tool is instrumental for researchers who are particularly interested in longitudinal studies, like those of tobacco use.

A few examples include the '1647 Surveys on [Smoking](/discover-data/smoking-datasets-and-studies), 6-11 July, 1976', '1649 Surveys on Smoking, 20-25 July, 1976', and the '1646 Surveys on Smoking, 11-17 June, 1976'. Each of these datasets is exemplary of how meticulous record-keeping and repeated observations allow researchers to undertake deep analyses at an individual level.

## How Does Harmony Work?

Harmony Discovery leverages the power of large language models to match questionnaire items and variable names. By doing so, it makes it exceedingly simple and efficient to find related datasets. This smart tool has connected to several prolific data sources which include [UKLLC](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk), [Closer](https://www.closer.ac.uk/), [The Catalogue of Mental Health Measures](https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/), [HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk), and [ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/). The integration of these sources ensures a wide variety of relevant datasets at researchers' fingertips.
