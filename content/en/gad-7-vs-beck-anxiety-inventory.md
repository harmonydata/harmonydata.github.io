Let's think about the comparison of GAD-7 vs Beck Anxiety Inventory. GAD-7, a seven-item instrument, assesses the severity of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) based on the individual's symptoms over the past two weeks. On the other hand, the Beck Anxiety Inventory is a 21-question self-report inventory measuring common somatic and cognitive symptoms of anxiety over the past week.
