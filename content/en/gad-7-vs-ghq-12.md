## Harmony: A Revolution in Comparing GAD-7 vs GHQ 12

Psychologists and social scientists around the world use tools like the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) and 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) for detecting psychological distress in patients. However, comparing these tools, or harmonising them, can be a daunting task. This process of harmonisation, which requires precise matching of questionnaire items, often leaves researchers scratching their heads with its time-consuming and subjective nature.
