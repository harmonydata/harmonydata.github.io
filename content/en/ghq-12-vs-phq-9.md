## Harmonising and comparing GHQ 12 vs PHQ-9: The Power of Harmony in Questionnaire Harmonisation

The world of psychological research is rich with extensive questionnaires crafted to delve into the intricacies of the human psyche. But as numerous and comprehensive as these tools are, a challenge often arises in comparing them. Two such essential instruments in the field of mental health are the 12 Item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ 12) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Drawing meaningful comparisons between these two might seem complex and strenuous, but Harmony is here to simplify it. Understanding GHQ 12 vs PHQ-9 The GHQ-12, designed as a unidimensional measure, is a popular tool for detecting psychological distress despite the debate around its structure. On the other hand, the PHQ-9 serves as the depression module within the self-administered PRIME-MD diagnostic tool, gauging the intensity of depression symptoms.
