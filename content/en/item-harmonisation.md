## Conquer the Chaos of Questionnaires:  Item harmonisation made easy

Researchers in psychology and social sciences frequently face a challenge: [comparing data from different questionnaires](/item-harmonisation/harmony-a-free-ai-tool-for-harmonisation-of-instruments-in-psychology/). For example, they may be [combining cohort studies](/item-harmonisation/harmony-a-free-ai-tool-to-combine-cohort-studies/) or [longitudinal studies](/item-harmonisation/harmony-a-free-ai-tool-for-longitudinal-study-in-psychology/) or [pooling data](/item-harmonisation/harmony-a-free-ai-tool-for-data-pooling/) for [cross cohort research](/item-harmonisation/harmony-a-free-ai-tool-for-cross-cohort-research/). Imagine trying to compare responses to "I often feel anxious" with "Feeling nervous, anxious or afraid" –  even though they seem similar, they might not capture the same level of anxiety. This is where **item harmonisation** comes in.

[Item harmonisation](/item-harmonisation/harmony-a-free-ai-tool-for-item-harmonisation/) ([item wise harmonisation](/item-harmonisation/harmony-a-free-ai-tool-for-item-wise-harmonisation/)) is the process of matching items across different questionnaires that measure the same construct (like anxiety) but use slightly different wording. It ensures researchers are truly comparing apples to apples, not apples to oranges. 

However, traditional item harmonisation can be a nightmare. As the study by Hoffmann et al (2024)  highlights,  it often involves  **tedious manual work**: sifting through lengthy PDFs and painstakingly transferring questions into spreadsheets. This is not only time-consuming but also prone to subjectivity depending on the researcher. 

Harmony is a free online tool that leverages the power of  [natural language processing (NLP)](/nlp-semantic-text-matching/measuring-the-performance-of-nlp-algorithms/) and  [generative AI models](/nlp-semantic-text-matching/) to streamline item harmonisation.

Here's how Harmony simplifies your work:

* **Effortless matching:**  Upload your questionnaires and Harmony uses  cutting-edge AI  to [identify semantically equivalent items](/item-harmonisation/find-matching-and-common-items-in-questionnaires-and-surveys/)  across different instruments. This eliminates the need for manual slogging through PDFs.
* **Goodbye language barriers:**  Harmony tackles questionnaires in  multiple languages. This opens doors to analysing data from a wider range of populations.
* **Time is precious:**  Harmony automates a significant portion of the item harmonisation process, freeing up your valuable research time.

## The benefits of effective item harmonisation

A recent study by Hoffmann et al (2024) underlines the importance of  **strategic item harmonisation**. Their research compared various harmonisation techniques and found that a well-chosen approach, like expert-based semantic harmonisation, can significantly improve the accuracy of comparisons between questionnaires. This translates to  more robust research findings**.
