## Validation and Harmonisation of Alcohol Urges Questionnaire (AUQ)

The Alcohol Urges Questionnaire (AUQ) is an 8-item self-administered questionnaire that assesses craving for alcohol among alcohol users in the current context. It provides a score that ranges from 8 (lowest craving value) to 56 (highest craving value).

Validation is a process of evaluating whether an instrument measures what it is intended to measure. In the case of the AUQ, validation would involve assessing whether the questionnaire effectively measures craving for alcohol in alcohol users.

Harmony can assist in the validation process by using its language models and comparing the items in the AUQ with other established instruments that measure craving for alcohol. This can provide researchers with a percentage match and help them determine the validity of the AUQ.

Additionally, researchers may also want to harmonise the AUQ with other established instruments. This involves finding which variables in the AUQ match variables in other instruments and establishing crosswalks. Harmony can assist in this process by using its natural language processing and AI models to compare items in different languages and provide a percentage match between the AUQ and other instruments. This can help researchers in cross-validating their results and making comparisons between different instruments in longitudinal studies.

Harmony's database includes a wide range of instruments, including the AUQ, making it easy for researchers to select the instruments they want to compare and validate. Alternatively, researchers can also upload their own instruments in PDF form to compare and harmonise with other instruments in the database.

In summary, Harmony can assist researchers in both validating and harmonising the Alcohol Urges Questionnaire (AUQ) with other instruments, making the process more efficient and accurate for longitudinal studies.
