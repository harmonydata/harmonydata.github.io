## Validation and Harmonisation of Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales-2 (AIMS2)

The Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales-2 (AIMS2) is a widely used instrument for assessing pain in individuals with arthritis. It consists of five items that assess typical pain, pain severity, and pain during specific times of the day, using a 5-point Likert scale ("all days" to "no days"). The possible range of scores is 0-10, with higher scores indicating more severe pain.

One challenge researchers face when using the AIMS2 is the need to compare and harmonise it with other instruments. This is important for establishing the validity of the AIMS2 and for conducting cross-study analyses.

Harmony is a software developed specifically for psychologists and social scientists, and it provides a solution for this challenge. Using natural language processing and generative AI models, Harmony can compare instruments and provide a percentage match between each item in the AIMS2 and other instruments. This allows researchers to easily identify and validate the matching variables between the AIMS2 and other instruments.

Furthermore, researchers can use Harmony's database of instruments or upload their own instruments in PDF form into the Harmony web interface. This flexibility allows researchers to easily harmonise the AIMS2 with a variety of other instruments, even if they are in different languages.

Overall, Harmony offers a comprehensive and efficient tool for validating and harmonising the AIMS2 with other instruments, which can greatly benefit researchers in their cohort and longitudinal studies on pain in individuals with arthritis.
