## Validation and Harmonisation of Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)

The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is a widely used self-report instrument designed to measure the severity of depressive symptoms in individuals aged 13 years and above. It is commonly used in both clinical and research settings to assess the presence and severity of depression in individuals.

However, in order to compare results across studies or combine data from different studies, researchers often need to harmonise the BDI-II with other instruments. This can be a time-consuming and subjective process, as it involves going through long PDFs of questionnaires and matching items manually.

This is where Harmony can be helpful. By utilizing natural language processing and generative AI models, Harmony can quickly and objectively compare items in the BDI-II with those in other instruments, even if they are in different languages. Researchers can simply select the BDI-II from Harmony's database or upload their own version in PDF form, and Harmony will provide a percentage match for each item with other instruments such as the PHQ-9 or GAD-7.

Furthermore, researchers may also want to validate the BDI-II by comparing it with other instruments that measure similar constructs. This can help establish the validity of the BDI-II as a measure of depression and identify any potential overlaps or differences with other instruments.

Overall, Harmony can be a valuable tool for researchers in the field of psychology, helping them save time and effort in the validation and harmonisation process of the BDI-II with other instruments.
