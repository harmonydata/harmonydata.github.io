## Validation and Harmonisation of Berg Balance Scale

The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) is a clinical measure used to assess balance in older adults, adults with neurological conditions, and other individuals with balance impairments. It consists of 14 tasks that assess different aspects of balance, such as sitting, standing, and walking.

One potential challenge with the BBS is that it may not always be feasible or appropriate to use it as the only measure of balance. In some cases, researchers or clinicians may want to compare the results from the BBS with other balance measures to gain a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's balance abilities.

This is where Harmony can be useful in helping researchers harmonise the BBS with other instruments. Harmony uses natural language processing and AI models to compare items in different questionnaires, including the BBS and other balance measures.

By using Harmony, researchers can assess the compatibility of the BBS with other instruments and establish crosswalks between different items. This can provide valuable insights into the construct validity of the BBS and its ability to effectively measure changes in an individual's balance over time.

Additionally, Harmony's database of instruments allows researchers to easily select and compare the BBS with other validated measures of balance in a variety of languages. This can be particularly useful for cross-cultural studies or when working with diverse populations.

Overall, Harmony can help researchers validate and harmonise the BBS with other instruments, providing a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of an individual's balance abilities.
