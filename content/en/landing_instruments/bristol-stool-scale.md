## Validation and Harmonisation of Bristol Stool Scale

The Bristol Stool Scale is a medical tool designed to classify the form of human feces into seven categories or types, ranging from constipation to diarrhea. It is used to assess the health and well-being of individuals and is often used in clinical settings.

In order to fully utilize the Bristol Stool Scale and its potential for longitudinal studies, researchers may want to validate its effectiveness in measuring changes over time. This is where Harmony can be helpful.

* [Validation and Harmonisation of Quickley-Hein plaque index (PI)](/harmonisation-validation/quickley-hein-plaque-index-pi)

Harmony uses natural language processing and AI models to compare and harmonise items from different instruments. Using Harmony, researchers can easily compare the variables in the Bristol Stool Scale with those in other instruments and establish crosswalks between them.

Additionally, Harmony can also assist in the validation process by providing a percentage match between the variables in the Bristol Stool Scale and those in other instruments. This can help researchers determine the integrity and effectiveness of the Bristol Stool Scale in measuring changes over time compared to other measurement tools.

Overall, Harmony can provide a more efficient and reliable way for researchers to validate and harmonise the Bristol Stool Scale with other instruments, allowing for more accurate and comprehensive analysis in longitudinal studies.
