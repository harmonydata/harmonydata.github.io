## Validation and Harmonisation of Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ)

The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) is a measure used in psychology and social sciences to assess patient satisfaction with treatment. It consists of 8-10 items and has a scoring range of 8-32.

Harmony, a software developed for psychologists and social scientists, can help researchers validate and harmonise the CSQ with other instruments.

Validation is important because it ensures that an instrument is able to accurately measure the construct it is intended to measure. Harmony uses large language models to compare items in the CSQ with items in other instruments. This allows researchers to assess the validity of the CSQ and see if it accurately reflects changes in the construct being measured. 

Moreover, researchers may want to harmonise the CSQ with other instruments in order to compare results and make cross-study comparisons. This is especially useful for longitudinal studies, where researchers want to see if results remain consistent over time or differ due to changing social conditions. Harmony's natural language processing and AI technology makes this process more efficient and less subjective. 

Researchers can either select the CSQ from Harmony's database or upload their own version of the questionnaire in PDF form. Harmony's web interface allows for easy drag and drop of instruments and compares items in multiple languages. This allows for harmonisation not only within the same language but also across different languages. 

In conclusion, Harmony is a valuable tool for researchers looking to validate and harmonise the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) with other instruments. Its technology allows for efficient and accurate comparisons, making it easier to make cross-study comparisons and assess the validity of the CSQ.
