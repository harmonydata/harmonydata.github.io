## Validation and Harmonisation of Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC)

The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) is a tool used in psychiatric research to assess the overall change in a patient's condition over a specific period of time. It is usually rated on a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 (Very Much Improved) to 7 (Very Much Worse).

Harmony can help researchers harmonise the CGIC with other instruments through its natural language processing and generative AI models. It can compare the items in CGIC with items in other instruments and give a percentage match. This not only saves time and effort for researchers, but also helps in establishing crosswalks between instruments.

* [Validation and Harmonisation of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index](/harmonisation-validation/pittsburgh-sleep-quality-index)

Moreover, Harmony's ability to compare items in multiple languages allows for cross-cultural validation of the CGIC. This is important in ensuring the validity of the tool and its applicability in different populations.

Overall, Harmony can assist researchers in harmonising the CGIC with other instruments, improving the efficiency and accuracy of their research and helping to establish the validity of the CGIC.
