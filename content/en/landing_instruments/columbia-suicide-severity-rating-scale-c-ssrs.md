## Validation and Harmonisation of Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)

The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a semi-structured interview used to assess the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during a specific assessment period. It includes definitions and suggested questions to gather relevant information for determining if a suicide-related thought or behavior has occurred.

Validation is an important aspect of instrument development and use. It refers to the degree to which an instrument measures what it is intended to measure. Researchers may want to validate the C-SSRS in order to determine if it accurately captures the construct of interest.

Harmony, a software developed for psychologists, can assist researchers in the validation and harmonization of the C-SSRS with other instruments. By using natural language processing and generative AI models, Harmony can compare items in the C-SSRS with those in other instruments and provide a percentage match. This can help researchers identify common variables and establish crosswalks between the C-SSRS and other instruments.

In addition, Harmony's ability to compare items in multiple languages can be useful for researchers looking to harmonize the C-SSRS with instruments in different languages. This can aid in the validation process, as it allows for cross-cultural comparisons and ensures the measure is valid across different linguistic and cultural groups.

By using Harmony, researchers can easily compare and harmonize the C-SSRS with other instruments, saving time and ensuring the validity of their research. This can also help facilitate the use of the C-SSRS in longitudinal studies, as it allows for comparisons of results across different time periods and studies. Overall, Harmony can significantly benefit the validation and harmonization of the C-SSRS, making it a valuable tool for researchers in their assessment of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors.
