## Validation and Harmonisation of Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS)

The Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) is an 18-item interview-based instrument used by psychologists to assess depression and anxiety symptoms. It includes two subscales, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Brief Scale for Anxiety (BSA), each ranging from 0 to 60 in severity.

Harmony, a software developed for psychologists, can aid in the validation and harmonisation of the CPRS with other instruments. Using natural language processing and generative AI models, Harmony can compare items in the CPRS with variables in other instruments, providing a percentage match between each item.

* [Validation and Harmonisation of Visual Analog Scale (VAS)](/harmonisation-validation/visual-analog-scale-vas)

This allows researchers to harmonise the CPRS with other instruments in longitudinal studies, allowing for comparisons within and across studies. It also aids in establishing crosswalks between the CPRS and other instruments, helping to validate the CPRS and ensure its effectiveness in measuring changes in the construct of interest. Overall, Harmony can save researchers time and effort in the time-consuming and subjective process of harmonisation, allowing for more efficient and accurate research in the field of psychology.
