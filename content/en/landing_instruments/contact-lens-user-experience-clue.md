## Validation and Harmonisation of Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE)

The Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE) is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire used to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses in a contact-lens wearing population. It measures aspects such as comfort, vision, handling, and packaging to determine the overall user experience.

Harmony, as a tool for harmonisation, can assist researchers in validating the CLUE or comparing it to other instruments. Here are some ways Harmony can help with this process:

* [Validation and Harmonisation of Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)](/harmonisation-validation/columbia-suicide-severity-rating-scale-c-ssrs)
* [Validation and Harmonisation of Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)](/harmonisation-validation/clinician-administered-ptsd-scale-caps)
* [CES-D vs SDQ](/compare-harmonise-instruments/ces-d-vs-sdq/)

1. Database of Instruments: Harmony has a database of instruments where researchers can select the CLUE and other instruments they want to compare. This makes it easier for researchers to find and select the relevant instruments for their study.

2. Natural Language Processing: Harmony uses natural language processing to match items from different questionnaires. This can help researchers find similar variables or concepts in the CLUE and other instruments, making it easier to harmonise them.

3. Generative AI Models: Harmony also utilizes generative AI models to provide a percentage match between items from different instruments. This can help researchers assess the level of agreement between the CLUE and other instruments, providing a measure of validity.

4. Crosswalks with Other Instruments: Researchers might also want to establish crosswalks between different instruments. Harmony can assist in this process by identifying and matching variables from the CLUE with those from other instruments, allowing for comparisons and validation.

Overall, Harmony can save researchers time and effort in the process of validating and harmonising the CLUE with other instruments. Its advanced technology allows for efficient and accurate comparisons, providing valuable insights into the user experience of contact lenses.
