## Validation and Harmonisation of Epworth Sleepiness Scale

The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a self-report questionnaire used to measure the level of daytime sleepiness in adults. It consists of 8 items, each rated from zero (no chance of dozing) to 3 (high chance of dozing), with a total score range from 0 (best) to 24 (worst).

In order to validate the ESS, researchers might want to compare it with other instruments that measure similar constructs, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index or the Insomnia Severity Index. They might also want to establish crosswalks between the ESS and other instruments, in order to compare data from different studies.

This is where Harmony can be useful. By using natural language processing and AI models, Harmony can compare the items in the ESS with items from other instruments and provide a percentage match. This allows researchers to determine which variables in the ESS align with variables in other instruments and establish crosswalks between them.

Additionally, Harmony can assist in validating the ESS by comparing it with other instruments that measure similar constructs. This helps researchers determine the degree of change in the construct being measured and establish the validity of the ESS as a measurement tool.

Overall, Harmony can save researchers time and effort in manually comparing and harmonising instruments, and can provide valuable insights for validating the ESS and crosswalking it with other instruments.
