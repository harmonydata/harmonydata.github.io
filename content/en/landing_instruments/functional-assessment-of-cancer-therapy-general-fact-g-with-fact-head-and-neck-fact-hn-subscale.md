## Validation and Harmonisation of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) with FACT-Head and Neck (FACT-HN) subscale

The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) is a widely used instrument for assessing quality of life (QOL) and functional status in cancer patients. It consists of 27 questions that assess four subscales: physical well-being, social well-being, emotional well-being, and functional well-being.

The FACT-Head and Neck (FACT-HN) subscale is a supplement to the FACT-G that focuses specifically on the impact of head and neck cancer on QOL and functional status. It consists of 39 questions that assess the same four subscales as the FACT-G.

To validate the FACT-G with FACT-HN subscale, researchers may want to compare it with other instruments that measure similar constructs. This is where Harmony can be useful.

Harmony uses natural language processing and AI models to compare questionnaire items and provide a percentage match between each item in different instruments, even if they are in different languages. This can help researchers identify which items in the FACT-G with FACT-HN subscale match with items in other instruments, allowing for cross-validation and harmonisation between different instruments.

Harmony's database also includes a variety of instruments, so researchers can easily select instruments and compare them to the FACT-G with FACT-HN subscale. They can also upload their own instruments in PDF form for comparison.

In addition to validation, researchers may also want to establish crosswalks between the FACT-G with FACT-HN subscale and other instruments. This involves finding which variables in one instrument correspond to variables in the other instrument. Harmony's AI models can help identify these correspondences and create crosswalks, making it easier for researchers to compare results from different instruments.

Overall, Harmony can aid in the validation and harmonisation of the FACT-G with FACT-HN subscale, allowing for better comparisons and understanding of QOL and functional status in cancer patients.
