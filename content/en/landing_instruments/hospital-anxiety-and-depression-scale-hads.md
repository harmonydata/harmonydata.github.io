## Validation and Harmonisation of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a widely used self-report tool that measures symptoms of anxiety and depression in clinical and non-clinical populations.

Harmony can assist researchers in validating the HADS by comparing it with other established instruments that measure similar constructs, such as the GAD-7 and PHQ-9.

Through its use of natural language processing and generative AI models, Harmony can identify items that are similar or highly correlated across different instruments, helping researchers establish crosswalks and harmonise the HADS with other instruments.

Furthermore, Harmony's ability to compare items in multiple languages can also assist researchers in validating translated versions of the HADS and establishing its cross-cultural validity.

Overall, by using Harmony, researchers can easily compare the HADS with other instruments and establish its validity and harmonisation in various studies and populations. This can help in improving the overall understanding and measurement of anxiety and depression in research and clinical settings.
