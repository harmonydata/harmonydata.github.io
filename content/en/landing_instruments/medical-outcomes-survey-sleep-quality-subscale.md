## Validation and Harmonisation of Medical Outcomes Survey Sleep Quality Subscale

The Medical Outcomes Survey Sleep Quality Subscale (MOS-SQS) is a standardized instrument used to assess the quality of sleep in patients. It is a 0-10 numeric rating scale, with 0 representing poor sleep quality and 10 representing a restful night of sleep.

Researchers may want to validate the MOS-SQS or harmonise it with other similar instruments in order to compare and combine data from different studies. This is where Harmony can be a useful tool.

Harmony uses natural language processing and generative AI models to compare instruments, including the MOS-SQS, and can give a percentage match between each item in the instrument. This can help researchers identify which variables in the MOS-SQS match variables in other instruments and establish crosswalks between them. 

Additionally, researchers can select the MOS-SQS from Harmony's database or upload their own version of the instrument in PDF form. Harmony can then analyse and compare the items in both versions, providing researchers with a harmonised version of the instrument.

By harmonising the MOS-SQS with other instruments, researchers can ensure that their data is consistent and comparable across different studies. This can improve the validity of their research and help them make more accurate and reliable conclusions.
