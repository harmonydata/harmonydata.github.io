## Validation and Harmonisation of Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)

The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) is a commonly used instrument in the field of pain assessment. It is a 0-10 scale, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst imaginable pain. It is a self-report measure and is typically used to assess pain intensity.

When using the NPRS, researchers may want to validate its effectiveness in measuring changes in pain over time. This is known as validity. However, comparing the results of the NPRS to other measures can be time-consuming and tedious.

This is where Harmony can help. Using natural language processing and AI, Harmony can quickly and accurately compare the NPRS to other instruments and establish crosswalks between them. This allows researchers to easily harmonise the NPRS with other measures, saving them time and effort.

Through Harmony's web interface, researchers can select the NPRS from their database or upload their own version of the instrument in PDF form. Harmony will then compare the items in the NPRS to items in other instruments, providing a percentage match between them.

By harmonising the NPRS with other measures, researchers can make more comprehensive comparisons and validate the effectiveness of the NPRS in measuring pain intensity. This can lead to better understanding and treatment of pain in patients.

In conclusion, Harmony is a valuable tool for psychologists researching pain assessment. It can save time and effort by harmonising the NPRS with other instruments and helping to establish the validity of the NPRS in measuring pain intensity.
