## Validation and Harmonisation of Overall Health-related Quality of Life (SF-36)

The Overall Health-related Quality of Life (SF-36) is a self-reported questionnaire commonly used to measure overall health status in research and healthcare settings. It consists of eight scaled scores, each measuring a different aspect of physical and mental health. Researchers often use this instrument to assess changes in health status over time or compare it with other similar instruments.

However, the process of validating and harmonising the Overall Health-related Quality of Life (SF-36) with other instruments can be time-consuming and subjective. This is where Harmony can be a valuable tool for researchers.

* [Validation and Harmonisation of Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE)](/harmonisation-validation/contact-lens-user-experience-clue)

Harmony uses natural language processing and generative AI models to compare items in the SF-36 with items in other instruments, even in different languages. This allows researchers to quickly and objectively identify which variables in the SF-36 match variables in other instruments. They can then establish crosswalks and harmonise the data to be used in their research.

Harmony can also assist in the validation process by providing a percentage match between each item in the SF-36 and other instruments, allowing researchers to assess the degree of similarity between the two.

Overall, Harmony streamlines and automates the process of validating and harmonising the Overall Health-related Quality of Life (SF-36) with other instruments, saving researchers time and effort while also ensuring more accurate and consistent results in their studies.
