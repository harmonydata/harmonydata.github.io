## Validation and Harmonisation of Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)

The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) is a participant-rated instrument used to measure the overall change in a participant's status over the course of a study. It is often used in [clinical trials](https://clinicaltrialrisk.org/) and longitudinal studies to assess the effectiveness of treatments, interventions, or changes in social conditions.

Harmony, the software developed for psychologists, can be a valuable tool for validating and harmonising the PGIC with other instruments. Harmony uses natural language processing and generative AI models to compare instruments and identify matching variables between different questionnaires, even if they are in different languages. This can greatly aid researchers in harmonising the PGIC with other instruments and establishing crosswalks between different measures.

## Why is validation important for the PGIC?

Validation is a crucial step in the research process, especially when it comes to measuring change in a specific construct. Without proper validation, the results of a study may be called into question and the data may not accurately represent the phenomenon being studied.

In the case of the PGIC, validation is important to ensure that the instrument is indeed measuring the desired construct of overall change in the participant's status. This involves comparing the PGIC with other instruments that are known to measure the same or similar constructs, and establishing the validity of the PGIC by demonstrating its ability to accurately measure change in the construct.

## How does Harmony aid in validating and harmonising the PGIC?

Harmony uses large language models to compare instruments and can give a percentage match between each item in instruments such as the PGIC and other questionnaires. This allows researchers to easily identify which variables in the PGIC match variables in other instruments, helping to establish crosswalks and harmonise the PGIC with other measures.

Additionally, Harmony's database of instruments and its ability to compare items in multiple languages makes it a valuable tool for researchers seeking to validate and harmonise the PGIC with other instruments, even if they are from different cultural or linguistic backgrounds.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, validation and harmonisation of the PGIC is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of results in research studies. Harmony, with its advanced language processing and AI capabilities, can greatly aid researchers in this process by identifying matching variables and establishing crosswalks between the PGIC and other instruments. This can ultimately improve the quality of research and further our understanding of the construct being measured.
