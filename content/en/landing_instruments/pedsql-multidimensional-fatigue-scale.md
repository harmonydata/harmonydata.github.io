## Validation and Harmonisation of PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale

The PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale is a questionnaire used to measure fatigue in children. It consists of three subscales: general fatigue, cognitive fatigue, and sleep-rest fatigue.

Harmony can assist researchers in validating and harmonising the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale with other instruments. Validation is the process of determining the degree to which an instrument accurately measures the construct it is intended to measure. By using Harmony, researchers can compare the items in the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale with items in other instruments and establish their crosswalks, allowing for better understanding and comparison of results across different studies.

* [Validation and Harmonisation of Alcohol Urges Questionnaire (AUQ)](/harmonisation-validation/alcohol-urges-questionnaire-auq)

Harmony's natural language processing and AI models can facilitate this process by highlighting similarities and differences between the items in the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale and other instruments. Researchers can then validate the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale by comparing its scores to those of the other instruments and assessing its reliability and validity.

Furthermore, Harmony allows for the harmonisation of the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale with other instruments in different languages. This can be particularly beneficial for cross-cultural studies or studies involving diverse populations. Researchers can use Harmony to compare the items in different languages and ensure that the translated versions of the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale are equivalent to the original version.

Overall, the use of Harmony can aid in the validation and harmonisation of the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, providing researchers with a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of fatigue in children. This can lead to better and more consistent results across studies, ultimately advancing the field of psychology and improving the measurement of fatigue in pediatric populations.
