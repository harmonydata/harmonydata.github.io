## Validation and Harmonisation of Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS)

The Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS) is a five-item self-administered instrument used to measure alcohol craving over the past week. It has a scoring range from 0 (lowest craving value) to 30 (highest craving value). The PACS is widely used by psychologists and researchers to assess alcohol craving in individuals and its effectiveness in treatment.

With the help of Harmony, researchers can validate the PACS and compare it with other instruments to establish crosswalks. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of alcohol craving and its measurement. By using Harmony, researchers can compare the items of the PACS with other instruments in different languages to ensure consistency and accuracy in measurement.

Harmony's natural language processing and AI models can also identify any discrepancies or overlaps between the PACS and other instruments. This can help researchers to refine and improve the PACS, and potentially create a more effective measurement tool for assessing alcohol craving.

Furthermore, researchers can use Harmony to harmonise the PACS with other instruments, such as the GAD-7 or PHQ-9, in order to compare results and test for consistency across studies. This allows for a deeper analysis of alcohol craving and its potential relationship with other psychological constructs.

In conclusion, Harmony can provide valuable assistance to researchers in validating, refining, and harmonising the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale with other instruments, leading to a better understanding of alcohol craving and its measurement in research and treatment.
