## Validation and Harmonisation of Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)

The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a commonly used instrument in psychology to measure the degree of stress in a person's life. It consists of 10 items designed to evaluate the levels of stress in three areas: overload, unpredictability, and lack of control.

Researchers often want to validate the PSS or harmonise it with other instruments to establish its reliability and make comparisons across studies. This is where Harmony can be a useful tool.

* [GHQ-12 vs SDQ](/ghq-12-vs-sdq)
* [SDQ vs Beck Anxiety Inventory](/sdq-vs-beck-anxiety-inventory)

Harmony's natural language processing and AI models can be used to compare the items in the PSS with those in other instruments, such as the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) or the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). By inputting the items into Harmony's web interface, researchers can receive a percentage match between each item, allowing them to make comparisons and establish crosswalks with other instruments.

Harmony's ability to compare instruments in multiple languages is also beneficial for researchers who work with diverse populations or conduct studies in different countries.

Moreover, by using Harmony, researchers can save time and effort that would otherwise be spent manually comparing and matching items from different questionnaires, as well as avoid subjective biases that can arise from such a process.

In short, Harmony can help researchers to validate and harmonise the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) with other instruments, making it easier to compare results and establish reliability across studies. This can ultimately lead to a better understanding of stress and its impact on individuals' lives.
