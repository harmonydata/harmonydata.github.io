## Validation and Harmonisation of Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)

The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) is a widely used self-reported instrument for measuring physical activity in older adults. It is designed to assess a range of activities that older adults may engage in, such as leisure, household, or work-related activities. The PASE has been shown to have good reliability and validity in measuring physical activity in older adults, making it a valuable tool in research studies.

However, researchers may still want to validate and harmonise the PASE with other instruments in order to compare data between studies or to assess its effectiveness for specific populations. This is where Harmony can be a useful software for psychologists.

Using Harmony, researchers can input the PASE into the software and compare it with other instruments in Harmony's database. The software uses natural language processing and generative AI models to identify matching items and provide a percentage match between the PASE and other instruments. This can help researchers validate the PASE and establish crosswalks with other instruments, allowing for comparison and harmonisation of data from different studies.

Furthermore, Harmony can also compare items in multiple languages, making it a versatile tool for international research studies. This can be particularly useful for validating and harmonising the PASE with instruments used in different languages or cultural contexts.

In conclusion, Harmony is a valuable software for psychologists that can aid in the validation and harmonisation of the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) with other instruments, allowing for more comprehensive and accurate analysis of physical activity data in older adults.
