## Validation and Harmonisation of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire that is widely used by researchers to measure overall sleep quality. It consists of 19 questions that assess different aspects of sleep, such as bedtime, sleep duration, sleep disturbances, and daytime dysfunction. The scores from these questions are then combined to yield a global score, which ranges from 0-21, with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality.

There are many other instruments that are used to measure sleep quality and researchers may want to compare their results with the PSQI. However, manually comparing and harmonising these instruments can be a time-consuming and subjective process. This is where Harmony can help.

Harmony uses natural language processing and generative AI models to compare instruments, including the PSQI, and provide a percentage match between each item. Researchers can either select instruments from Harmony's database or upload their own instruments in PDF form to compare.

By harmonising the PSQI with other instruments, researchers can establish crosswalks and find which variables in the PSQI match variables in other instruments. This can help researchers validate the PSQI and determine its effectiveness in measuring sleep quality compared to other instruments. As a result, researchers can make more informed decisions on which instrument to use in their studies and ensure consistency in their results.

Furthermore, using Harmony to validate and harmonise the PSQI can also help with longitudinal studies. By comparing results from the PSQI over time and across different studies, researchers can track changes in sleep quality and determine if these changes are consistent or vary depending on different social conditions.

In conclusion, Harmony is a valuable tool for psychologists and social scientists who work with the PSQI. It can save time, provide objective comparisons, and help establish validity and consistency in sleep quality measurements.
