## Validation and Harmonisation of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a widely used questionnaire measure that assesses sleep quality in adults. It consists of 19 individual items, which are used to generate seven component scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction. A global score can also be calculated by summing the individual component scores, with a higher score indicating poorer sleep quality.

Harmony can be a useful tool for researchers who are looking to validate the PSQI or compare it with other sleep quality instruments. Through its advanced natural language processing algorithms, Harmony can identify and compare similar items between the PSQI and other instruments, allowing researchers to establish crosswalks and determine the degree of similarity or differences between them.

* [Validation and Harmonisation of SIRS scale (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome)](/harmonisation-validation/sirs-scale-systemic-inflammatory-response-syndrome)

In addition, Harmony can help researchers harmonise the PSQI with other instruments by identifying and aligning similar variables or constructs, allowing for more efficient and accurate comparisons across studies. This can be particularly valuable for longitudinal studies looking to assess changes in sleep quality over time, as researchers can use Harmony to ensure consistency in their assessments and identify any discrepancies or differences in results. 

Overall, Harmony can be a useful tool for validating and harmonising the PSQI with other instruments, aiding researchers in their studies on sleep quality and potentially leading to more standardized and comparable data in the field.
