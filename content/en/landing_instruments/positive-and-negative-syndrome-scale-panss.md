## Validation and Harmonisation of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)

The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a widely used instrument in the field of psychiatry, specifically in the evaluation of schizophrenia. It consists of 30 items that assess the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and social withdrawal. The PANSS has been found to be a valid and reliable measure of the severity of schizophrenia symptoms. However, in order to make comparisons with other instruments or across studies, it is important to validate the PANSS and harmonise it with other measures.

Harmony can be a valuable tool for researchers in the validation and harmonisation of the PANSS. By using its natural language processing and AI capabilities, Harmony can compare the items in the PANSS with items in other instruments, both within and across studies. This can help researchers identify which variables in the PANSS match with variables in other measures, and establish crosswalks between the PANSS and other instruments.

Furthermore, Harmony's ability to compare items in multiple languages can be particularly helpful for researchers working with international cohorts or in cross-cultural studies. The PANSS has been translated into many languages, and with Harmony, researchers can easily validate and harmonise the translated versions of the scale with its original English version.

In addition, Harmony's database includes a wide range of instruments commonly used in psychology and social science research, including other measures of schizophrenia symptoms. Researchers can select these instruments from Harmony's database to compare and harmonise with the PANSS, saving them time and effort in manually searching and comparing instruments.

Overall, Harmony can be a useful tool for psychologists and social scientists in the validation and harmonisation of the PANSS, allowing for more robust and accurate comparisons between studies and instruments.
