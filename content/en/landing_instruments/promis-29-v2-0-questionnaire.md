## Validation and Harmonisation of PROMIS-29 v2.0 questionnaire

The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a set of measures that assess various health domains such as physical, mental, and social health. The PROMIS-29 v2.0 questionnaire is a widely used instrument that measures patient-reported outcomes for adults in multiple domains.

Harmony can help researchers harmonise the PROMIS-29 v2.0 questionnaire with other instruments by using its natural language processing and generative AI models. Researchers can input the questionnaire into Harmony's web interface and compare it with other instruments in Harmony's database or drag and drop their own instruments in PDF form.

This process can help researchers validate the PROMIS-29 v2.0 questionnaire by comparing it with other instruments and establishing crosswalks. Validating an instrument is important as it ensures that the instrument is accurately measuring the intended outcome and can effectively capture changes over time.

Moreover, by harmonising the PROMIS-29 v2.0 questionnaire with other instruments, researchers can make comparisons both within and across studies. This allows for a more comprehensive analysis and understanding of the data collected.

In conclusion, Harmony can aid researchers in validating and harmonising the PROMIS-29 v2.0 questionnaire with other instruments, promoting efficiency and accuracy in research.
