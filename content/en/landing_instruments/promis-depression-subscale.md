## Validation and Harmonisation of PROMIS depression subscale

The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a set of questionnaires designed to assess various aspects of a person's physical, mental, and social health. The PROMIS depression subscale specifically measures the severity of depressive symptoms in individuals.

The subscale consists of eight items, rated on a scale of 0-4 with higher scores indicating more severe depression. It has been validated and extensively used in research and clinical settings.

However, researchers may want to validate or harmonise the PROMIS depression subscale with other instruments in their studies. This can help them better understand the relationship between depression and other variables, as well as make comparisons between different studies.

This is where Harmony can be used. By comparing the items in the PROMIS depression subscale with other instruments, Harmony can provide a percentage match between them. This allows researchers to see which variables in the PROMIS depression subscale are similar to those in other instruments.

Additionally, Harmony's large language models can also help in validating the PROMIS depression subscale by assessing its ability to measure changes in the construct of depression. By using multiple instruments and comparing the results, researchers can determine the validity of the PROMIS depression subscale and its effectiveness in measuring changes in depression over time.

In summary, Harmony can assist researchers in harmonising the PROMIS depression subscale with other instruments, as well as validating its use in studies. This can ultimately lead to a better understanding of depression and its impact on individuals' overall health and well-being.
