## Validation and Harmonisation of Quality of Life (QoL) EORTC QLQ-C30

The Quality of Life (QoL) EORTC QLQ-C30 is a commonly used questionnaire designed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. It contains 30 items that cover aspects such as physical, emotional, and social functioning, as well as symptoms and overall quality of life.

To ensure the validity of the QoL EORTC QLQ-C30, researchers may want to validate it against other instruments or harmonise it with other similar questionnaires. This helps to establish the reliability of the QoL EORTC QLQ-C30 and allows for comparisons to be made across studies.

* [GHQ-12 vs Beck Anxiety Inventory](/compare-harmonise-instruments/ghq-12-vs-beck-anxiety-inventory/)

Harmony software can be a valuable tool for this process by using natural language processing and generative AI models to compare the items in QoL EORTC QLQ-C30 with items in other instruments. Researchers can select instruments from Harmony's database or upload their own instruments in PDF form to compare them.

Harmony can also compare items in multiple [languages](/psychology-ai-tool/harmony-many-languages), making it easier for researchers to harmonise instruments across different languages and cultures.

By using Harmony, researchers can save time and reduce subjectivity in the harmonisation process. They can also establish crosswalks between different instruments, allowing for more comprehensive comparisons and analyses in their research. Overall, Harmony can greatly aid in the validation and harmonisation of the Quality of Life (QoL) EORTC QLQ-C30 and other similar questionnaires.
