## Validation and Harmonisation of Quickley-Hein plaque index (PI)

The Quickley-Hein plaque index (PI) is a tool used by dentists to measure the amount of plaque on a patient's teeth. It is determined by visually inspecting the buccal and lingual surfaces of each tooth and scoring them on a scale from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating a greater amount of plaque. 

Harmony can assist researchers in validating and harmonising the Quickley-Hein plaque index (PI) with other instruments. Validity is an important aspect of any instrument, as it measures the degree to which the instrument is able to accurately measure the construct it is intended to measure. By using Harmony's language models, researchers can compare the variables in the Quickley-Hein plaque index (PI) with those in other instruments and establish crosswalks between them.

This means that researchers can use Harmony to determine if the Quickley-Hein plaque index (PI) is measuring the same construct as other plaque index instruments, and if there are any discrepancies or overlaps between them. This validation process can help researchers decide if the Quickley-Hein plaque index (PI) is a reliable and accurate tool to use in their studies.

Additionally, researchers can also use Harmony to harmonise the Quickley-Hein plaque index (PI) with other instruments. Harmonisation is the process of comparing and aligning items from different instruments, allowing for easier comparison and analysis of data. By using Harmony, researchers can harmonise the Quickley-Hein plaque index (PI) with other plaque index instruments, potentially creating a standardized measure that can be used across studies.

Overall, by using Harmony, researchers can validate and harmonise the Quickley-Hein plaque index (PI) with other instruments, helping to improve the reliability and comparability of data collected using this index.
