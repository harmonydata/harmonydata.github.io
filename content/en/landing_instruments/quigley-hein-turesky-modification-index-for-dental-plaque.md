## Validation and Harmonisation of Quigley-Hein, Turesky Modification Index for Dental Plaque 

The Quigley-Hein, Turesky Modification Index for Dental Plaque is a standardized measurement tool used to assess the amount of dental plaque, a bacterial biofilm that can cause tooth decay and gum disease, on a person's teeth. The scale ranges from 0 to 5, with 0 representing no plaque and 5 representing extensive plaque coverage on the tooth surface.

Harmony, a software developed for psychologists, can assist in the harmonisation of this index with other instruments. Using natural language processing and generative AI models, Harmony can compare the items in the Quigley-Hein, Turesky Modification Index to items in other instruments and give a percentage match for each item. This can help researchers identify which variables in the index correspond to variables in other instruments, allowing for the validation and crosswalking of the index.

Overall, Harmony can aid in the process of validating and harmonising the Quigley-Hein, Turesky Modification Index for Dental Plaque, making it easier for researchers to compare and combine data from different studies. This can lead to a better understanding of the construct being measured and potential improvements in the measurement tool itself.
