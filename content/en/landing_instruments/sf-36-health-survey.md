## Validation and Harmonisation of SF-36 health survey

The SF-36 health survey is a widely used questionnaire to measure an individual's overall health and well-being. It consists of eight subscales, including physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality (energy/fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health.

In order to validate the SF-36 health survey, researchers need to compare it with other established instruments that measure similar constructs. This process, known as cross-validation, helps to establish the reliability and validity of the SF-36 health survey.

Harmony can assist researchers in this process by using its large language models to compare items from the SF-36 health survey with items from other instruments. This can help researchers identify which variables in the SF-36 match variables in other instruments, and establish crosswalks between them.

By harmonising the SF-36 with other instruments, researchers can also make comparisons between studies and ensure consistency in their results. Additionally, Harmony's natural language processing capabilities can help researchers identify any discrepancies or issues within the questionnaire, improving the overall quality of the instrument.

Overall, Harmony can greatly benefit researchers in the validation and harmonisation of the SF-36 health survey, providing a more efficient and accurate process for establishing its reliability and validity.
