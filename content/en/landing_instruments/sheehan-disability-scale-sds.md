## Validation and Harmonisation of Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)

The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) is a commonly used instrument in clinical trials and research studies to measure functional impairment and disability in individuals. It consists of 5 items that assess disability in work, social life/leisure, and family life/home responsibilities, with higher scores indicating greater impairment.

Harmony can help researchers with the validation and harmonisation of the SDS by comparing it with other relevant instruments in its database. This can assist researchers in understanding the degree to which the SDS is able to accurately measure change in the construct it is intended to measure. Harmony can also help establish crosswalks between the SDS and other instruments, allowing for comparisons and potential integration of data from different studies.

Through the use of natural language processing and AI models, Harmony can compare the items in the SDS with items in other instruments, even if they are in different languages. This can save researchers a significant amount of time and effort in manually comparing and matching items from different questionnaires.

In addition, researchers can also use Harmony to harmonise their own instruments by simply uploading them in PDF form into the web interface. Harmony's use of large language models can provide a percentage match between each item in the SDS and the other instrument, giving researchers a better understanding of the level of harmonisation between the two.

Harmony's ability to validate and harmonise the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) with other instruments can greatly benefit researchers and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of psychology. By ensuring the validity of the SDS and facilitating its integration with other instruments, Harmony can assist researchers in conducting more comprehensive and reliable studies.
