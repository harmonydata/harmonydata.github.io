## Cohort Studies



Cohort studies are a fundamental research design in the social sciences and medical fields, providing impactful insights by following groups of individuals with common characteristics over time. These longitudinal studies allow researchers to explore the effects of various exposures, treatments, and behaviors on specific outcomes, such as the incidence of diseases or psychological changes.

Given the complexity and volume of data involved in cohort studies, it's crucial for researchers to have efficient tools to discover relevant studies, datasets, and variables. This is where Harmony Discovery becomes indispensable. Leveraging cutting-edge large language models, Harmony Discovery revolutionizes the way researchers search for and access cohort studies.

We are working on an extension to the Harmony tool, called [Harmony Discovery](https://harmonydiscovery.fastdatascience.com/), which will allow researchers to discover cohort studies via an integration with different data providers.
