## Longitudinal Studies



Longitudinal studies are invaluable in understanding the intricacies of developmental patterns, the impacts of interventions, and the progression of conditions over time. By repeatedly examining the same individuals, researchers can detect changes and draw conclusions about cause-and-effect relationships. While this type of study is prevalent in medicine, economics, and epidemiology, its application spans across various social and medical sciences.

## Discovering Longitudinal Studies with Harmony Discovery

We are working on an extension to the Harmony tool, called [Harmony Discovery](https://harmonydiscovery.fastdatascience.com/), which will allow researchers to discover longitudinal studies via an integration with different data providers.
