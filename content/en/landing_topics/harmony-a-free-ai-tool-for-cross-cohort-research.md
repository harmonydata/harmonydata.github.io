What is harmonization, you might ask? It refers to the process of matching items from different questionnaires, such as determining if "I often feel anxious" in one questionnaire is equivalent to "Feeling nervous, anxious or afraid" in another questionnaire. This task is often time-consuming and subject to human error, making it a tedious and daunting task for researchers.

Harmony utilizes cutting-edge natural language processing and generative AI models to help researchers harmonize questionnaire items, even if they are in different languages. This means that with Harmony, researchers can easily compare instruments from different studies and languages, allowing for greater cross-cohort research.

The benefits of using Harmony are numerous. It saves time and reduces subjectivity, making the harmonization process more efficient and accurate. This is especially important for longitudinal studies, where researchers need to compare results over time. Harmony can also provide a percentage match between items, giving researchers a better understanding of the similarities and differences between instruments.

Using Harmony is easy and convenient. Researchers can choose from instruments already in Harmony's database, or they can simply drag and drop their own instruments in PDF form into the web interface at https://harmonydata.ac.uk/app. This makes it accessible to all researchers, regardless of their level of technical expertise.

In conclusion, Harmony is a valuable tool for psychologists and social scientists who want to make meaningful comparisons within and across studies. Its AI technology streamlines the harmonization process, making it a must-have tool for any researcher looking to conduct cross-cohort research. Best of all, it's completely free to use.
