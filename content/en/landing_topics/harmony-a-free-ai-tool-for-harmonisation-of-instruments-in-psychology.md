## Harmony: A Free AI Tool for Harmonisation Of Instruments In Psychology

Harmony is a powerful software developed specifically for psychologists and social scientists. Its main purpose is to help with the process of [item harmonisation](/item-harmonisation/), which involves matching items from different questionnaires.

The tool utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI models to assist researchers in harmonising questionnaire items, even if they are in different languages. This saves time and reduces subjectivity in the harmonisation process.

* [CES-D vs SDQ](/ces-d-vs-sdq)

One of the major benefits of using Harmony is that it allows for easy comparison of instruments in longitudinal studies. By repeating the same analysis across multiple studies, researchers can determine if the results are consistent or if they vary due to changing social conditions. This is important in order to make full use of cohort and longitudinal studies.

Harmony has a large database of instruments that users can select from, or they can upload their own instruments in PDF form. The AI models used by Harmony can compare items and provide a percentage match between instruments such as GAD-7 and PHQ-9.

What sets Harmony apart from other harmonisation tools is its ability to compare items in multiple languages. This allows for harmonisation of instruments used in international studies, making it a valuable tool for researchers across the globe.

To use Harmony, simply visit their website at https://harmonydata.ac.uk/app and either select instruments from their database or upload your own. With its advanced AI technology, Harmony makes harmonisation a more efficient and accurate process, helping researchers make better use of their data.
