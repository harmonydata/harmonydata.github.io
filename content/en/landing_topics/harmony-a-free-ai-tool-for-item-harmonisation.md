## Harmony: A Free AI Tool for Item Harmonisation

Harmony is an innovative software specifically designed for psychologists and social scientists to help with the time-consuming task of harmonizing questionnaire items. It utilizes natural language processing and generative AI models to compare items from different questionnaires, even in different languages.

One of the key features of Harmony is its ability to match items from various questionnaires, such as "I often feel anxious" and "Feeling nervous, anxious or afraid." This process, known as harmonization, is crucial for making comparisons within and across studies. By using Harmony, researchers can save valuable time and effort in manually harmonizing items.

In addition to the built-in database of instruments, Harmony also allows researchers to upload their own instruments in PDF form through its user-friendly web interface at https://harmonydata.ac.uk/app. This gives users the flexibility to use their preferred instruments and seamlessly integrate them into their study.

Harmony's advanced language models can provide a percentage match between items from different instruments, such as GAD-7 and PHQ-9. This makes it easier for researchers to analyze and compare longitudinal data from multiple studies. This not only saves time but also improves the accuracy and consistency of results.

Another advantage of using Harmony is its ability to compare items in multiple languages. This is particularly beneficial for cross-cultural research, where language differences can pose a challenge in harmonizing items from different instruments.

In conclusion, Harmony is a valuable tool for psychologists and social scientists, helping them with the essential process of harmonizing questionnaire items. With its AI-powered technology and user-friendly interface, Harmony makes it easier and faster for researchers to compare instruments and analyze data from longitudinal studies.
