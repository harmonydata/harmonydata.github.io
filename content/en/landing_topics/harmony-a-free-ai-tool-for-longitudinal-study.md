## Harmony: A Free AI Tool for Longitudinal Study

Harmony is a powerful software designed specifically for psychologists and social scientists. Its main purpose is to assist researchers in harmonising questionnaire items in longitudinal studies, saving time and improving accuracy.

One of the key features of Harmony is its natural language processing and generative AI models, which are used to compare items in different questionnaires. This can be especially helpful when working with studies in different languages, as Harmony can automatically match similar items and give a percentage match for each one. This ensures consistency and accuracy in comparison across studies.

Using Harmony is also very user-friendly. Researchers can easily select instruments from Harmony's comprehensive database or upload their own instruments in PDF form. This eliminates the need for manually inputting data and makes the process more efficient.

The benefits of using Harmony extend beyond just saving time and improving accuracy. By being able to compare instruments in longitudinal studies, researchers can test the consistency of results across different studies, or see how changes in social conditions may impact the results.

Harmony is a free tool and can be accessed through its web interface at https://harmonydata.ac.uk/app. Its use of AI technology makes it a valuable resource for psychologists and social scientists looking to make meaningful comparisons in their longitudinal research. Give Harmony a try and see how it can enhance your study!
