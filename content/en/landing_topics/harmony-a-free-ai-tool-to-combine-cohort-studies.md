## Harmony: A Free AI Tool to Combine Cohort Studies


Harmony is an innovative software that has been specifically designed for psychologists and social scientists to streamline the harmonization process. The tool uses natural language processing and generative AI models to compare questionnaire items, even in different languages.

One of the main features of Harmony is its ability to match items in different questionnaires, ultimately making the process of harmonization faster and more accurate. This is crucial for psychologists as they often have to compare and analyze data from multiple studies, including longitudinal studies. With Harmony, researchers can easily make comparisons within and across studies, allowing for a deeper understanding of the data and potential changes in social conditions.

Additionally, Harmony has a user-friendly web interface where researchers can select instruments from the database or upload their own instruments in PDF form. The tool's large language models can compare items from different instruments, such as GAD-7 and PHQ-9, and provide a percentage match for each item.

One of the major benefits of using Harmony is that it saves significant time and effort for researchers. Going through lengthy PDFs and manually inputting data into Excel can be a tedious and subjective process. With Harmony, this process is automated, allowing for more efficient and reliable results.

Moreover, Harmony is a free tool, making it accessible to all researchers. It can greatly improve the quality and accuracy of data analysis in cohort studies, ultimately advancing the field of psychology and social science research.

In conclusion, Harmony is a valuable tool for psychologists and social scientists, providing them with an efficient and accurate way to harmonize data from multiple studies. By utilizing AI technology, Harmony offers a streamlined and user-friendly approach to data analysis, improving the overall quality of research in this field.
