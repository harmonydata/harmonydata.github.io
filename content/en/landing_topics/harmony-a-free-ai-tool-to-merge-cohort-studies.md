## Harmony: A Free AI Tool to Merge Cohort Studies

Harmony is a software that uses natural language processing and generative AI models to assist psychologists in [harmonising questionnaire items](/item-harmonisation/). Whether researchers are merging items from different questionnaires or comparing instruments in longitudinal studies, Harmony can efficiently analyse and match items in multiple languages.

One of the main challenges for psychologists and social scientists is the time-consuming and subjective process of harmonisation. Going through long PDFs of questionnaires and manually transferring items into Excel can be tedious and prone to errors. Harmony offers a solution by automating this process and providing accurate and consistent results.

* [Harmony: A Free AI Tool for Longitudinal Study](/item-harmonisation/harmony-a-free-ai-tool-for-longitudinal-study)

By using large language models, Harmony can give a percentage match between each item in instruments such as GAD-7 and PHQ-9. This feature is particularly useful for researchers who want to make comparisons both within and across studies. By repeating the same longitudinal analysis across a number of studies, researchers can test whether their results are consistent or if they differ in response to changing social conditions.

What sets Harmony apart is its flexibility in instrument selection. Users can choose from Harmony's database of instruments or easily upload their own instruments in PDF form into the web interface at https://harmonydata.ac.uk/app. This allows researchers to work with the specific instruments they need and seamlessly integrate Harmony into their workflow.

Overall, Harmony is a powerful tool for psychologists looking to streamline their research process and make reliable comparisons across studies. By leveraging AI technology, Harmony offers a user-friendly and efficient solution for harmonising questionnaire items and promoting data harmonisation in the field of psychology.
