With Harmony, researchers have a revolutionary tool that utilizes natural language processing and generative AI models to harmonize questionnaire items of both similar and different languages seamlessly. As researchers, we know the PHQ-9 is a self-administered instrument evaluating each of the nine DSM-IV criteria for depression. Meanwhile, the Beck Anxiety Inventory measures 21 common somatic and cognitive symptoms of anxiety. Both serve their own purpose, but finding their common and contrasting elements â€“ that's where the real challenge lies.
