We have a partnership with [Professor Louise Arsenault](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/louise-arseneault) at the [Catalogue of Mental Health Measures](https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/). [John Rogers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-rogers-3a64545) of [Delosis](https://www.delosis.com/), who developed the Catalogue of Mental Health Measures, is working on Harmony on software development.

From within the Harmony web app, once Harmony has calculated your matches, you can click the Mental Health Catalogue logo to search for studies using a particular instrument. We are working on a bidirectional integration with the Mental Health Catalogue.
