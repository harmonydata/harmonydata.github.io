# Tracking Harmony issues and raising feedback

Have you found a problem with Harmony?

You can use the links on the Harmony homepage at harmonydata.ac.uk - you can see there are buttons titled *Raise NLP issue* and *Raise UI issue*, which take you to the process for logging issues in Github.

The issues remain in the issue trackers and can be assigned to people either under "Assignee" or in the comments:

* Harmony Python library issue tracker: https://github.com/harmonydata/harmony/issues - this is everything to do with the NLP logic of Harmony
* Harmony API issue tracker: https://github.com/harmonydata/harmonyapi/issues
* Harmony front end issue tracker: https://github.com/harmonydata/app/issues - this is everything to do with the front end and graphical interface of Harmony

If you're unsure where to put an issue, feel free to just raise it on any of the issue boards.

In these issue trackers, you can see each item and who's working on it. You can also see closed issues in this view.


You can discuss issues in our Discord [https://discord.gg/harmonydata](https://discord.gg/harmonydata) - the link is also on the homepage.

If you're a developer, check out [our developer guide](/developer-guide/) which explains how to use Github! And don't forget to [join our community](/community/).
