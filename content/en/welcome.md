    Harmony is an open source tool which uses AI to help researchers use text data in areas such as mental health. Harmony is a web tool and a Python and R library. Researchers use Harmony to combine (harmonise) questions in questionnaires, where different wording is used, such as "I feel anxious" and "feeling nervous". We are also developing a discovery platform which lets researchers discover datasets.
