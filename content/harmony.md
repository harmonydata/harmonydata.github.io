# Harmonising **Mental Health** Data

Do you need to compare questionnaire data across studies? Do you want to find the best match for a set of items? Are there are different versions of the same questionnaire floating around and you want to make sure how compatible they are? Are the questionnaires written in different languages that you would like to compare?

Harmony is a **data harmonisation** project that uses Natural Language Processing to help researchers make better use of existing data from different studies by supporting them with the harmonisation of various measures and items used in different studies. Harmony is a collaboration project between the University of Ulster, University College London, the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria in Brazil, and Fast Data Science Ltd.

###### Wellcome Trust

##  Wellcome Data Prizes

The Wellcome Trust has established the Wellcome Data Prizes, which are targeted at multidisciplinary teams who are using existing data to answer important research questions around mental health and the active ingredients of existing interventions. The prizes are focused on health challenges in four areas: climate and health, infectious disease, mental health and discovery research.

Dr. Eoin McElroy and Dr Bettina Moltrecht have joined up to bring together a multidisciplinary team from [UCL](https://ucl.ac.uk/), the [University of Ulster](https://www.ulster.ac.uk/), [Universidade de Santa Maria](https://www.ufsm.br/) and [Fast Data Science](https://fastdatascience.com)[ ](http://fastdatascience.com/)to develop a new tool that uses state of the art natural language processing called Harmony.

Researchers across the globe can benefit from Harmony, as it will help facilitate global mental health research and collaborations. Through Harmony researchers will be able to draw on multiple studies to answer pressing research questions around mental health and its underlying causes. Being able to harmonise measures across studies is the first step to combining different data resources, which is needed to advance current mental health research. For example, our team wants to investigate the effect of human connection on mental health and wellbeing over time, and we will use Harmony to compare measures and data from two countries, the UK and Brazil.

## The Harmony Method

Our tool, Harmony, allows researchers to upload a set of mental health questionnaires in PDF or Excel format, such as the GAD-7 anxiety questionnaire. It identifies which questions among questionnaires are identical, similar in meaning, or antonyms of each other, and generates a network graph. This allows researchers to harmonise datasets.

Uniquely, Harmony relies on Transformer neural network architectures and is not dependent on a dictionary approach or word list. This allows for multilingual support (English and Portuguese are our languages of focus), and Harmony is able to correctly map the GAD-7 used in the UK to the GAD-7 used in Brazil, despite the Brazilian questionnaire being in Brazilian Portuguese.

Using Harmony, our team was able to conduct groundbreaking research into social isolation and anxiety with NLP supplying a quantitative measure of the equivalence of the different mental health datasets.

###### Harmony

#### A global platform for contextual harmonisation, translation and cooperation in mental health research

This team will support better integration of mental health research through a **natural language processing** harmonisation tool (Harmony), allowing researchers to compare data from existing studies to investigate the active ingredients of mental health. Led by Dr Eoin McElroy from Ulster University and Dr Bettina Moltrecht from University College London, the team will develop and demonstrate Harmony to answer research questions around human connection and its influence on the development of depression and anxiety in young people.
