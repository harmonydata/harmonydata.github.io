## Using the new Harmony in the browser

**Summary**

Harmony is a tool that helps researchers harmonize and compare questionnaires and instruments across social sciences, market research, and political polling. The video shows how to use Harmony to integrate data from different sources.

The video begins by showing how to upload a PDF or Excel file of a questionnaire into Harmony. If the file is a PDF, Harmony will extract the questions from it. If the extraction fails, the user can edit or delete rows.

The video then shows how to select multiple questionnaires to be harmonized. In this example, the user selects the CES-D, SCARED English questionnaire, and GAD-7 Portuguese questionnaire collected in Brazil.

Once the questionnaires have been selected, Harmony will match the questions from each questionnaire to the questions in the other questionnaires. The user can then adjust the match threshold percentage to control how strict or lenient the question match is.

The video concludes by showing how to export the harmonized data from Harmony.

Here are some of the key features of Harmony:

* It can harmonize questionnaires in PDF or Excel format.
* It can match questions from different questionnaires based on their meaning, not just their exact wording.
* It allows the user to adjust the match threshold percentage to control how strict or lenient the question match is.
* It can export the harmonized data in a variety of formats, including Excel, CSV, and JSON.
* Harmony is a powerful tool that can help researchers harmonize and compare questionnaires and instruments across different sources. It is easy to use and can be customised to meet the specific needs of the user.
